Axiom C5 in [Megill] p. 444 (p. 11 of the preprint).  Also appears as Axiom B6 (p. 75) of system S2 of [Tarski] p. 77 and Axiom C5-1 of [Monk2] p. 113. (This theorem simply repeats ~ ax-5 so that we can include the following note, which applies only to the obsolete axiomatization.) This axiom is _logically_ redundant in the (logically complete) predicate calculus axiom system consisting of ~ ax-gen , ~ ax-c4 , ~ ax-c5 , ~ ax-11 , ~ ax-c7 , ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-c9 , ~ ax-c10 , ~ ax-c11 , ~ ax-8 , ~ ax-9 , ~ ax-c14 , ~ ax-c15 , and ~ ax-c16 : in that system, we can derive any instance of ~ ax-5 not containing wff variables by induction on formula length, using ~ ax5eq and ~ ax5el for the basis together ~ hbn , ~ hbal , and ~ hbim .  However, if we omit this axiom, our development would be quite inconvenient since we could work only with specific instances of wffs containing no wff variables - this axiom introduces the concept of a setvar variable not occurring in a wff (as opposed to just two setvar variables being distinct).
