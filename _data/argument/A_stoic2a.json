Statement T2 of [Bobzien] p. 117 shows a reconstructed version of Stoic logic thema 2 as follows:  \"When from two assertibles a third follows, and from the third and one (or both) of the two another follows, then this other follows from the first two.\" Bobzien uses constructs such as ` ph ` , ` ps |- ch ` ; in Metamath we will represent that construct as ` ph /\\ ps -> ch ` . This version a is without the phrase \"or both\"; see ~ stoic2b for the version with the phrase \"or both\".  We already have this rule as ~ syldan , so here we show the equivalence and discourage its use. (New usage is discouraged.)  (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 17-Feb-2019.) ",
