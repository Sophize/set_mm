This law is thought to have originated with Aristotle (_Metaphysics_, Book VII, Part 17).  It is one of the three axioms of Ayn Rand's philosophy (_Atlas Shrugged_, Part Three, Chapter VII).  While some have proposed extending Rand's axiomatization to include Compassion and Kindness, others fear that such an extension may flirt with logical inconsistency.
