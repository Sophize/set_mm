  "remarks" : " Define a general binary relation.  Note that the syntax is simply three class symbols in a row.  Definition 6.18 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 29 generalized to arbitrary classes.  Class ` R ` often denotes a relation such as \" ` < ` \" that compares two classes ` A ` and ` B ` , which might be numbers such as ` 1 ` and ` 2 ` (see ~ df-ltxr for the specific definition of ` < ` ).  As a wff, relations are true or false.  For example, ` ( R = { <. 2 , 6 >. , <. 3 , 9 >. } -> 3 R 9 ) ` ( ~ ex-br ). Often class ` R ` meets the ` Rel ` criteria to be defined in ~ df-rel , and in particular ` R ` may be a function (see ~ df-fun ).  This definition of relations is well-defined, although not very meaningful, when classes ` A ` and/or ` B ` are proper classes (i.e. are not sets). On the other hand, we often find uses for this definition when ` R ` is a proper class (see for example ~ iprc ).  (Contributed by NM, 31-Dec-1993.) \n\n---\n\n Define a general binary relation.
