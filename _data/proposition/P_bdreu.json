  "remarks" : " Boundedness of existential uniqueness. Remark regarding restricted quantifiers: the formula ` A. x e. A ph ` need not be bounded even if ` A ` and ` ph ` are.  Indeed, ` _V ` is bounded by ~ bdcvv , and ` |- ( A. x e. _V ph <-> A. x ph ) ` (in minimal propositional calculus), so by ~ bd0 , if ` A. x e. _V ph ` were bounded when ` ph ` is bounded, then ` A. x ph ` would be bounded as well when ` ph ` is bounded, which is not the case.  The same remark holds with ` E. , E! , E* ` .  (Contributed by BJ, 16-Oct-2019.) ",
