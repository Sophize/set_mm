  "remarks" : " Axiom _Frege_.  Axiom A2 of [Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of propositional calculus.  It \"distributes\" an antecedent over two consequents.  This axiom was part of Frege's original system and is known as _Frege_ in the literature; see Proposition 2 of [Frege1879] p. 26.  It is also proved as Theorem *2.77 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 108.  The other direction of this axiom also turns out to be true, as demonstrated by ~ pm5.41 .  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.) \n\n---\n\n Axiom _Frege_.  Axiom A2 of [Margaris] p. 49.
