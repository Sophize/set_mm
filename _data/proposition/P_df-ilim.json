  "remarks" : " Define the limit ordinal predicate, which is true for an ordinal that has the empty set as an element and is not a successor (i.e. that is the union of itself).  Our definition combines the definition of Lim of [BellMachover] p. 471 and Exercise 1 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 42, and then changes ` A =/= (/) ` to ` (/) e. A ` (which would be equivalent given the law of the excluded middle, but which is not for us).  (Contributed by Jim Kingdon, 11-Nov-2018.)  Use its alias ~ dflim2 instead for naming consistency with set.mm.  (New usage is discouraged.) ",
