  "remarks" : " Axiom of Union.  An axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.  It states that a set ` y ` exists that includes the union of a given set ` x ` i.e. the collection of all members of the members of ` x ` .  The variant ~ axun2 states that the union itself exists.  A version with the standard abbreviation for union is ~ uniex2 .  A version using class notation is ~ uniex . The union of a class ~ df-uni should not be confused with the union of two classes ~ df-un .  Their relationship is shown in ~ unipr . (Contributed by NM, 23-Dec-1993.) \n\n---\n\n Axiom of Union.  An axiom of Intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.  It states that a set ` y ` exists that includes the union of a given set ` x ` i.e. the collection of all members of the members of ` x ` .  The variant ~ axun2 states that the union itself exists.  A version with the standard abbreviation for union is ~ uniex2 .  A version using class notation is ~ uniex . This is Axiom 3 of [Crosilla] p.  \"Axioms of CZF and IZF\", except (a) unnecessary quantifiers are removed, (b) Crosilla has a biconditional rather than an implication (but the two are equivalent by ~ bm1.3ii ), and (c) the order of the conjuncts is swapped (which is equivalent by ~ ancom ). The union of a class ~ df-uni should not be confused with the union of two classes ~ df-un .  Their relationship is shown in ~ unipr . (Contributed by NM, 23-Dec-1993.) ",
