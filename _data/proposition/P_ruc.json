  "remarks" : " The set of positive integers is strictly dominated by the set of real numbers, i.e. the real numbers are uncountable.  The proof consists of lemmas ~ ruclem1 through ~ ruclem13 and this final piece.  Our proof is based on the proof of Theorem 5.18 of [Truss] p. 114.  See ~ ruclem13 for the function existence version of this theorem.  For an informal discussion of this proof, see ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmcomplex.html#uncountable .  For an alternate proof see ~ rucALT .  This is Metamath 100 proof #22. (Contributed by NM, 13-Oct-2004.) ",
