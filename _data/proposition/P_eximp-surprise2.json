  "remarks" : " Show that \"there exists\" with an implication is always true if there exists a situation where the antecedent is false. Those inexperienced with formal notations of classical logic may use expressions combining \"there exists\" with implication.  This is usually a mistake, because that combination does not mean what an inexperienced person might think it means.  For example, if there is some object that does not meet the precondition ` ph ` , then the expression ` E. x ( ph -> ps ) ` as a whole is always true, no matter what ` ps ` is ( ` ps ` could even be false, ` F. ` ).  New users of formal notation who use \"there exists\" with an implication should consider if they meant \"and\" instead of \"implies\".  See ~ eximp-surprise , which shows what implication really expands to.  See also ~ empty-surprise . (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 18-Oct-2018.) ",
