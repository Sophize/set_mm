To read this intuitionistically, think of it as \"if ` ph ` can be refuted for all ` x ` , then it is not possible to find an ` x ` for which ` ph ` holds\" (and likewise for the converse). Comparing this with ~ dfexdc illustrates that statements which look similar (to someone used to classical logic) can be different intuitionistically due to different placement of negations.
