  "remarks" : " Define the function for the norm of a vector of Hilbert space.  See ~ normval for its value and ~ normcl for its closure.  Theorems ~ norm-i-i , ~ norm-ii-i , and ~ norm-iii-i show it has the expected properties of a norm.  In the literature, the norm of ` A ` is usually written \"|| ` A ` ||\", but we use function notation to take advantage of our existing theorems about functions.  Definition of norm in [Beran] p. 96.  (Contributed by NM, 6-Jun-2008.)  (New usage is discouraged.) ",
