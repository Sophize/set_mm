  "remarks" : " Define the structure component index extractor.  See theorem ~ ndxarg to understand its purpose.  The restriction to ` NN ` allows ` ndx ` to exist as a set, since ` _I ` is a proper class.  In principle, we could have chosen ` CC ` or (if we revise all structure component definitions such as ~ df-base ) another set such as the natural ordinal numbers ` _om ` ( ~ df-om ).
