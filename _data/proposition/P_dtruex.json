  "remarks" : " At least two sets exist (or in terms of first-order logic, the universe of discourse has two or more objects).  Although ~ dtruarb can also be summarized as \"at least two sets exist\", the difference is that ~ dtruarb shows the existence of two sets which are not equal to each other, but this theorem says that given a specific ` y ` , we can construct a set ` x ` which does not equal it.
