  "remarks" : " Axiom of Quantifier Substitution.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Appears as Lemma L12 in [Megill] p. 445 (p. 12 of the preprint). The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-c11 and was replaced with this shorter ~ ax-c11n (\"n\" for \"new\") in May 2008.  The old axiom is proved from this one as theorem ~ axc11 .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from ~ ax-c11 as theorem ~ axc11nfromc11 . This axiom was proved redundant in July 2015.  See theorem ~ axc11n . This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used.  It is proved above as theorem ~ axc11n .  (Contributed by NM, 16-May-2008.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
