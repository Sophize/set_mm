  "remarks" : " Polynomials over ` ZZ ` with an arbitrary index set, that is, the smallest ring of functions containing all constant functions and all projections.  This is almost the most general reasonable definition; to reach full generality, we would need to be able to replace ZZ with an arbitrary (semi-)ring (and a coordinate subring), but rings have not been defined yet.
