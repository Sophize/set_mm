  "remarks" : " Define the proper substitution of a class for a set. When ` A ` is a proper class, our definition evaluates to false.  This is somewhat arbitrary: we could have, instead, chosen the conclusion of ~ sbc6 for our definition, which always evaluates to true for proper classes. Our definition also does not produce the same results as discussed in the proof of Theorem 6.6 of [Quine] p. 42 (although Theorem 6.6 itself does hold, as shown by ~ dfsbcq below).  For example, if ` A ` is a proper class, Quine's substitution of ` A ` for ` y ` in ` 0 e. y ` evaluates to ` 0 e. A ` rather than our falsehood.  (This can be seen by substituting ` A ` , ` y ` , and ` 0 ` for alpha, beta, and gamma in Subcase 1 of Quine's discussion on p. 42.)  Unfortunately, Quine's definition requires a recursive syntactical breakdown of ` ph ` , and it does not seem possible to express it with a single closed formula. If we did not want to commit to any specific proper class behavior, we could use this definition _only_ to prove theorem ~ dfsbcq , which holds for both our definition and Quine's, and from which we can derive a weaker version of ~ df-sbc in the form of ~ sbc8g .  However, the behavior of Quine's definition at proper classes is similarly arbitrary, and for practical reasons (to avoid having to prove sethood of ` A ` in every use of this definition) we allow direct reference to ~ df-sbc and assert that ` [. A / x ]. ph ` is always false when ` A ` is a proper class. The theorem ~ sbc2or shows the apparently \"strongest\" statement we can make regarding behavior at proper classes if we start from ~ dfsbcq . The related definition ~ df-csb defines proper substitution into a class variable (as opposed to a wff variable).  (Contributed by NM, 14-Apr-1995.)
