  "remarks" : " The indiscrete topology on a set ` A ` expressed as a topological space, using direct component assignments.  Compare with ~ indistps .  The advantage of this version is that it is the shortest to state and easiest to work with in most situations.  Theorems ~ indistpsALT and ~ indistps2ALT show that the two forms can be derived from each other. (Contributed by NM, 24-Oct-2012.) ",
