This theorem tells us that any variable, including ` x ` , is effectively not free in ` x = x ` , even though ` x ` is technically free according to the traditional definition of free variable.  (The proof uses only ~ ax-5 , ~ ax-8 , ~ ax-12 , and ~ ax-gen .  This shows that this can be proved without ~ ax-9 , even though the theorem ~ equid cannot be.  A shorter proof using ~ ax-9 is obtainable from ~ equid and ~ hbth .)  (Contributed by NM, 13-Jan-2011.)  (Proof shortened by Wolf Lammen, 23-Mar-2014.) ",
