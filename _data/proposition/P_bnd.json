  "remarks" : " A very strong generalization of the Axiom of Replacement (compare ~ zfrep6 ), derived from the Collection Principle ~ cp .  Its strength lies in the rather profound fact that ` ph ( x , y ) ` does not have to be a \"function-like\" wff, as it does in the standard Axiom of Replacement.  This theorem is sometimes called the Boundedness Axiom. (Contributed by NM, 17-Oct-2004.) \n\n---\n\n A very strong generalization of the Axiom of Replacement (compare ~ zfrep6 ).
