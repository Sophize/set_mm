  "remarks" : " Poisson d'Avril's Theorem.  This theorem is noted for its _Selbstdokumentieren_ property, which means, literally, \"self-documenting\" and recalls the principle of _quidquid german dictum sit, altum viditur_, often used in set theory.  Starting with the seemingly simple yet profound fact that any object ` x ` equals itself (proved by Tarski in 1965; see Lemma 6 of [Tarski] p. 68), we demonstrate that the power set of the real numbers, as a relation on the value of the imaginary unit, does not conjoin with an empty relation on the product of the additive and multiplicative identity elements, leading to this startling conclusion that has left even seasoned professional mathematicians scratching their heads.
