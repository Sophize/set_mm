  "remarks" : " Axiom of Right Equality for Binary Predicate.  One of the equality and substitution axioms for a non-logical predicate in our predicate calculus with equality.  It substitutes equal variables into the right-hand side of an arbitrary binary predicate ` e. ` , which we will use for the set membership relation when set theory is introduced.  This axiom scheme is a sub-scheme of Axiom Scheme B8 of system S2 of [Tarski], p. 75, whose general form cannot be represented with our notation.  Also appears as Axiom scheme C13' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). (Contributed by NM, 21-Jun-1993.) ",
