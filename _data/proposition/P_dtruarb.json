  "remarks" : " At least two sets exist (or in terms of first-order logic, the universe of discourse has two or more objects).  This theorem asserts the existence of two sets which do not equal each other; compare with ~ dtruex in which we are given a set ` y ` and go from there to a set ` x ` which is not equal to it.
