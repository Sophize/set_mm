  "remarks" : " This series of theorems provide a means of exchanging the consequent of an implication chain via a simple implication.  In the main part, the theorems ~ ax-mp , ~ syl , ~ syl6 , ~ syl8 form the beginning of this series.  These theorems are replicated here, but with proofs that aim at a recursive scheme, allowing to base a proof on that of the previous one in the series.  (Contributed by Wolf Lammen, 17-Nov-2019.) ",
