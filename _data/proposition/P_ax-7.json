  "remarks" : " Axiom of Equality.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  This is similar to, but not quite, a transitive law for equality (proved later as ~ equtr ).  This axiom scheme is a sub-scheme of Axiom Scheme B8 of system S2 of [Tarski], p. 75, whose general form cannot be represented with our notation.  Also appears as Axiom C7 of [Monk2] p. 105 and Axiom Scheme C8' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). The equality symbol was invented in 1527 by Robert Recorde.  He chose a pair of parallel lines of the same length because \"noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle.\" Note that this axiom is still valid even when any two or all three of ` x ` , ` y ` , and ` z ` are replaced with the same variable since they do not have any distinct variable (Metamath's $d) restrictions.  Because of this, we say that these three variables are \"bundled\" (a term coined by Raph Levien).  (Contributed by NM, 10-Jan-1993.) ",
