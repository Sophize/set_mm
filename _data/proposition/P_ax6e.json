  "remarks" : " At least one individual exists.  This is not a theorem of free logic, which is sound in empty domains.  For such a logic, we would add this theorem as an axiom of set theory (Axiom 0 of [Kunen] p. 10).  In the system consisting of ~ ax-4 through ~ ax-9 , all axioms other than ~ ax-6 are believed to be theorems of free logic, although the system without ~ ax-6 is not complete in free logic. It is preferred to use ~ ax6ev when it is sufficient.  (Contributed by NM, 14-May-1993.)  Shortened after ~ axc9lem1 became available. (Revised by Wolf Lammen, 8-Sep-2018.) ",
