  "remarks" : " The set ` _om ` is transitive.  A natural number is included in ` _om ` . The idea is to use bounded induction with the formula ` x C_ _om ` . This formula, in a logic with terms, is bounded.  So in our logic without terms, we need to temporarily replace it with ` x C_ a ` and then deduce the original claim.
