  "remarks" : " ` 0 ` is an identity element for real addition.  Axiom for real and complex numbers, derived from set theory.  This construction-dependent theorem should not be referenced directly; instead, use ~ ax-0id . In the Metamath Proof Explorer this is not a complex number axiom but is instead proved from other axioms.  That proof relies on excluded middle and it is not known whether it is possible to prove this from the other axioms without excluded middle.  (Contributed by Jim Kingdon, 16-Jan-2020.)
