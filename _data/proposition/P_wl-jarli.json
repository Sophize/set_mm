  "remarks" : " Dropping a nested consequent.  This theorem is one of two reversions of ~ ja .  Since ~ ja is reversible, one can conclude, that a nested (chain of) implication(s) is just a packed notation of two or more theorems/ hypotheses with a common consequent. ~ axc5c7 is an instance of this idea.
