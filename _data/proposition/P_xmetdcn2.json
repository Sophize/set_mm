  "remarks" : " The metric function of an extended metric space is always continuous in the topology generated by it.  In this variation of ~ xmetdcn we use the metric topology instead of the order topology on ` RR* ` , which makes the theorem a bit stronger.  Since ` +oo ` is an isolated point in the metric topology, this is saying that for any points ` A , B ` which are an infinite distance apart, there is a product neighborhood around ` <. A , B >. ` such that ` d ( a , b ) = +oo ` for any ` a ` near ` A ` and ` b ` near ` B ` , i.e. the distance function is locally constant ` +oo ` .  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 5-May-2014.)
