  "remarks" : " The power set of an aleph is not strictly dominated by the successor aleph.  (The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis says they are equinumerous, see ~ gch3 or ~ gchaleph2 .)  The transposed form ~ alephsucpw cannot be proven without the AC, and is in fact equivalent to it.  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 2-Feb-2013.) ",
