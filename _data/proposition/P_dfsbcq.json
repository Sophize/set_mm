  "remarks" : " Proper substitution of a class for a set in a wff given equal classes. This is the essence of the sixth axiom of Frege, specifically Proposition 52 of [Frege1879] p. 50. This theorem, which is similar to Theorem 6.7 of [Quine] p. 42 and holds under both our definition and Quine's, provides us with a weak definition of the proper substitution of a class for a set.  Since our ~ df-sbc does not result in the same behavior as Quine's for proper classes, if we wished to avoid conflict with Quine's definition we could start with this theorem and ~ dfsbcq2 instead of ~ df-sbc .  ( ~ dfsbcq2 is needed because unlike Quine we do not overload the ~ df-sb syntax.)  As a consequence of these theorems, we can derive ~ sbc8g , which is a weaker version of ~ df-sbc that leaves substitution undefined when ` A ` is a proper class. However, it is often a nuisance to have to prove the sethood hypothesis of ~ sbc8g , so we will allow direct use of ~ df-sbc after theorem ~ sbc2or below.  Proper substitution with a proper class is rarely needed, and when it is, we can simply use the expansion of Quine's definition.
