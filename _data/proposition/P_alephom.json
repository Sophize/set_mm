  "remarks" : " From ~ canth2 , we know that ` ( aleph `` 0 ) < ( 2 ^ _om ) ` , but we cannot prove that ` ( 2 ^ _om ) = ( aleph `` 1 ) ` (this is the Continuum Hypothesis), nor can we prove that it is less than any bound whatsoever (i.e. the statement ` ( aleph `` A ) < ( 2 ^ _om ) ` is consistent for any ordinal ` A ` ).  However, we can prove that ` ( 2 ^ _om ) ` is not equal to ` ( aleph `` _om ) ` , nor ` ( aleph `` ( aleph `` _om ) ) ` , on cofinality grounds, because by Konig's Theorem ~ konigth (in the form of ~ cfpwsdom ), ` ( 2 ^ _om ) ` has uncountable cofinality, which eliminates limit alephs like ` ( aleph `` _om ) ` .  (The first limit aleph that is _not_ eliminated is ` ( aleph `` ( aleph `` 1 ) ) ` , which has cofinality ` ( aleph `` 1 ) ` .)  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 21-Mar-2013.) ",
