  "remarks" : " Every set has a transitive closure (the smallest transitive extension). Theorem 9.1 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 73.  See ~ trcl for an explicit expression for the transitive closure.  Apparently open problems are whether this theorem can be proved without the Axiom of Infinity; if not, then whether it implies Infinity; and if not, what is the \"property\" that Infinity has that the other axioms don't have that is weaker than Infinity itself? (Added 22-Mar-2011) The following article seems to answer the first question, that it can't be proved without Infinity, in the affirmative: Mancini, Antonella and Zambella, Domenico (2001).  \"A note on recursive models of set theories.\" _Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic_, 42(2):109-115.  (Thanks to Scott Fenton.)  (Contributed by NM, 15-Sep-2003.) ",
