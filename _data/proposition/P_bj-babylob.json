L&ouml;b's theorem when the L&ouml;b sentence is given as a hypothesis (the hard part of the proof of L&ouml;b's theorem is to construct this L&ouml;b sentence; this can be done, using G&ouml;del diagonalization, for any first-order effectively axiomatizable theory containing Robinson arithmetic).  More precisely, the present theorem states that if a first-order theory proves that the provability of a given sentence entails its truth (and if one can construct in this theory a provability predicate and a L&ouml;b sentence, given here as the first hypothesis), then the theory actually proves that sentence. See for instance, Eliezer Yudkowsky, _The Cartoon Guide to L&ouml;b's Theorem_ (available at ~ http://yudkowsky.net/rational/lobs-theorem/ ). (Contributed by BJ, 20-Apr-2019.) ",
