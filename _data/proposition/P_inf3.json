  "remarks" : " Our Axiom of Infinity ~ ax-inf implies the standard Axiom of Infinity. The hypothesis is a variant of our Axiom of Infinity provided by ~ inf2 , and the conclusion is the version of the Axiom of Infinity shown as Axiom 7 in [TakeutiZaring] p. 43.  (Other standard versions are proved later as ~ axinf2 and ~ zfinf2 .)  The main proof is provided by ~ inf3lema through ~ inf3lem7 , and this final piece eliminates the auxiliary hypothesis of ~ inf3lem7 .  This proof is due to Ian Sutherland, Richard Heck, and Norman Megill and was posted on Usenet as shown below.  Although the result is not new, the authors were unable to find a published proof. <HTML> <PRE> (As posted to sci.logic on 30-Oct-1996, with annotations added.) Theorem:  The statement \"There exists a nonempty set that is a subset of its union\" implies the Axiom of Infinity. Proof:  Let X be a nonempty set which is a subset of its union; the latter property is equivalent to saying that for any y in X, there exists a z in X such that y is in z. Define by finite recursion a function F:omega-->(power X) such that F_0 = 0  (See ~ inf3lemb .) F_n+1 = {y&lt;X | y^X subset F_n}  (See ~ inf3lemc .) Note: ^ means intersect, &lt; means \\in (\"element of\"). (Finite recursion as typically done requires the existence of omega; to avoid this we can just use transfinite recursion restricted to omega. F is a class-term that is not necessarily a set at this point.) Lemma 1.  F_n subset F_n+1.  (See ~ inf3lem1 .) Proof:  By induction:  F_0 subset F_1.  If y &lt; F_n+1, then y^X subset F_n, so if F_n subset F_n+1, then y^X subset F_n+1, so y &lt; F_n+2. Lemma 2.  F_n =/= X.  (See ~ inf3lem2 .) Proof:  By induction:  F_0 =/= X because X is not empty.  Assume F_n =/= X. Then there is a y in X that is not in F_n.  By definition of X, there is a z in X that contains y.  Suppose F_n+1 = X.  Then z is in F_n+1, and z^X contains y, so z^X is not a subset of F_n, contrary to the definition of F_n+1. Lemma 3.  F_n =/= F_n+1.  (See ~ inf3lem3 .) Proof:  Using the identity y^X subset F_n &lt;-> y^(X-F_n) = 0, we have F_n+1 = {y&lt;X | y^(X-F_n) = 0}.  Let q = {y&lt;X-F_n | y^(X-F_n) = 0}. Then q subset F_n+1.  Since X-F_n is not empty by Lemma 2 and q is the set of \\in-minimal elements of X-F_n, by Foundation q is not empty, so q and therefore F_n+1 have an element not in F_n. Lemma 4.  F_n proper_subset F_n+1.  (See ~ inf3lem4 .) Proof:  Lemmas 1 and 3. Lemma 5.  F_m proper_subset F_n, m &lt; n.  (See ~ inf3lem5 .) Proof:  Fix m and use induction on n > m.  Basis: F_m proper_subset F_m+1 by Lemma 4.  Induction:  Assume F_m proper_subset F_n.  Then since F_n proper_subset F_n+1, F_m proper_subset F_n+1 by transitivity of proper subset. By Lemma 5, F_m =/= F_n for m =/= n, so F is 1-1.  (See ~ inf3lem6 .) Thus, the inverse of F is a function with range omega and domain a subset of power X, so omega exists by Replacement.
