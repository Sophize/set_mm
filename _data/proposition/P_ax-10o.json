  "remarks" : " Axiom ~ ax-10o (\"o\" for \"old\") was the original version of ~ ax-10 , before it was discovered (in May 2008) that the shorter ~ ax-10 could replace it.  It appears as Axiom scheme C11' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). This axiom is redundant, as shown by theorem ~ ax10o . Normally, ~ ax10o should be used rather than ~ ax-10o , except by theorems specifically studying the latter's properties.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)  (New usage is discouraged.) ",
