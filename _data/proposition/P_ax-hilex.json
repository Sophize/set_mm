  "remarks" : " This is our first axiom for a complex Hilbert space, which is the foundation for quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.  We assume that there exists a primitive class, ` ~H ` , which contains objects called vectors.  (Contributed by NM, 16-Aug-1999.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
