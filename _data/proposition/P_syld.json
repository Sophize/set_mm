Notice that ~ syld has the same form as ~ syl with ` ph ` added in front of each hypothesis and conclusion.  When all theorems referenced in a proof are converted in this way, we can replace ` ph ` with a hypothesis of the proof, allowing the hypothesis to be eliminated with ~ id and become an antecedent.  The Deduction Theorem for propositional calculus, e.g.  Theorem 3 in [Margaris] p. 56, tells us that this procedure is always possible. \n\n---\n\n Syllogism deduction.
