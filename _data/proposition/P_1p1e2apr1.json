  "remarks" : " One plus one equals two.  Using proof-shortening techniques pioneered by Mr.  Mel L. O'Cat, along with the latest supercomputer technology, Prof. Loof Lirpa and colleagues were able to shorten Whitehead and Russell's 360-page proof that 1+1=2 in _Principia Mathematica_ to this remarkable proof only two steps long, thus establishing a new world's record for this famous theorem.  (Contributed by Prof.  Loof Lirpa, 1-Apr-2008.) (Proof modification is discouraged.)  (New usage is discouraged.) ",
