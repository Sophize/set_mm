This proof is a popular example in the literature and is identical, step for step, to the proofs of Theorem 1 of [Margaris] p. 51, Example 2.7(a) of [Hamilton] p. 31, Lemma 10.3 of [BellMachover] p. 36, and Lemma 1.8 of [Mendelson] p. 36.

Note that the second occurrence of ` ph ` in Steps 1 to 4 and the sixth in Step 3 may simultaneously be replaced by any wff ` ps ` , which may ease the understanding of the proof.  For a shorter version of the proof that takes advantage of previously proved theorems, see ~ id .  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.)  (New usage is discouraged.)
