  "remarks" : " A degenerate form of antecedent swapping.  The number '1' in the theorem name indicates that it handles a chain of length 1. Since there is just one antecedent in the chain, there is nothing to swap.  Non-degenerated forms begin with ~ wl-impchain-com-1.2 , for more see there.  (Contributed by Wolf Lammen, 7-Jul-2019.)
