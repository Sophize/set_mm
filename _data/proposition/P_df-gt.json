  "remarks" : " The 'greater than' relation is merely the converse of the 'less than or equal to' relation defined by ~ df-lt .  Defined in ISO 80000-2:2009(E) operation 2-7.12.  See ~ df-gte for a discussion on why this approach is used for the definition.  See ~ gt-lt and ~ gt-lth for more conventional expression of the relationship between ` < ` and ` > ` . As a stylistic issue, set.mm prefers 'less than or equal' instead of 'greater than or equal' to reduce the number of conversion steps.  Thus, we discourage its use, but include its definition so that there _is_ a formal definition of this symbol. (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 19-Apr-2015.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
