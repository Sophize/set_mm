  "remarks" : " Weak deduction theorem that eliminates a hypothesis ` ph ` , making it become an antecedent.  We assume that a proof exists for ` ph ` when the class variable ` A ` is replaced with a specific class ` B ` .  The hypothesis ` ch ` should be assigned to the inference, and the inference's hypothesis eliminated with ~ elimhyp .  If the inference has other hypotheses with class variable ` A ` , these can be kept by assigning ~ keephyp to them.  For more information, see the Deduction Theorem ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmdeduction.html .  (Contributed by NM, 15-May-1999.) ",
