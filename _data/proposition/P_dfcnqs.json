  "remarks" : " Technical trick to permit reuse of previous lemmas to prove arithmetic operation laws in ` CC ` from those in ` R. ` .  The trick involves ~ qsid , which shows that the coset of the converse epsilon relation (which is not an equivalence relation) acts as an identity divisor for the quotient set operation.  This lets us \"pretend\" that ` CC ` is a quotient set, even though it is not (compare ~ df-c ), and allows us to reuse some of the equivalence class lemmas we developed for the transition from positive reals to signed reals, etc.  (Contributed by NM, 13-Aug-1995.)
