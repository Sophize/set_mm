  "remarks" : " Axiom of Variable Substitution.  One of the 5 equality axioms of predicate calculus.  The final consequent ` A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ` is a way of expressing \" ` y ` substituted for ` x ` in wff ` ph ` \" (cf. ~ sb6 ).  It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105, from which it can be proved by cases. Variants of this axiom which are equivalent in classical logic but which have not been shown to be equivalent for intuitionistic logic are ~ ax11v , ~ ax11v2 and ~ ax-11o .
