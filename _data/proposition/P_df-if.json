  "remarks" : " Define the conditional operator.  Read ` if ( ph , A , B ) ` as \"if ` ph ` then ` A ` else ` B ` .\"  See ~ iftrue and ~ iffalse for its values.  In mathematical literature, this operator is rarely defined formally but is implicit in informal definitions such as \"let f(x)=0 if x=0 and 1/x otherwise.\"  (In older versions of this database, this operator was denoted \"ded\" and called the \"deduction class.\") An important use for us is in conjunction with the weak deduction theorem, which converts a hypothesis into an antecedent.  In that role, ` A ` is a class variable in the hypothesis and ` B ` is a class (usually a constant) that makes the hypothesis true when it is substituted for ` A ` .  See ~ dedth for the main part of the weak deduction theorem, ~ elimhyp to eliminate a hypothesis, and ~ keephyp to keep a hypothesis.  See the Deduction Theorem link on the Metamath Proof Explorer Home Page for a description of the weak deduction theorem.

In mathematical literature, this operator is rarely defined formally but is implicit in informal definitions such as \"let f(x)=0 if x=0 and 1/x otherwise.\" In the absence of excluded middle, this will tend to be useful where ` ph ` is decidable (in the sense of ~df-dc ).
