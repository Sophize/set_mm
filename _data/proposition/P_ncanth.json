  "remarks" : " Cantor's theorem fails for the universal class (which is not a set but a proper class by ~ vprc ).  Specifically, the identity function maps the universe onto its power class.  Compare ~ canth that works for sets.  See also the remark in ~ ru about NF, in which Cantor's theorem fails for sets that are \"too large.\"  This theorem gives some intuition behind that failure: in NF the universal class is a set, and it equals its own power set.
