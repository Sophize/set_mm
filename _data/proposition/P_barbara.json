  "remarks" : " \"Barbara\", one of the fundamental syllogisms of Aristotelian logic.  All ` ph ` is ` ps ` , and all ` ch ` is ` ph ` , therefore all ` ch ` is ` ps ` .  (In Aristotelian notation, AAA-1:  MaP and SaM therefore SaP.) For example, given \"All men are mortal\" and \"Socrates is a man\", we can prove \"Socrates is mortal\".  If H is the set of men, M is the set of mortal beings, and S is Socrates, these word phrases can be represented as ` A. x ( x e. H -> x e. M ) ` (all men are mortal) and ` A. x ( x = S -> x e. H ) ` (Socrates is a man) therefore ` A. x ( x = S -> x e. M ) ` (Socrates is mortal).  Russell and Whitehead note that the \"syllogism in Barbara is derived...\" from ~ syl .  (quote after Theorem *2.06 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 101).  Most of the proof is in ~ alsyl .  There are a legion of sources for Barbara, including ~ http://www.friesian.com/aristotl.htm , ~ http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/ , and ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism .
