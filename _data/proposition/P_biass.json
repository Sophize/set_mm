An axiom of system DS in Vladimir Lifschitz, \"On calculational proofs\", Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, 113:207-224, 2002, ~ http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ai-lab/pub-view.php?PubID=26805 . Interestingly, this law was not included in _Principia Mathematica_ but was apparently first noted by Jan Lukasiewicz circa 1923.  (Contributed by NM, 8-Jan-2005.)
