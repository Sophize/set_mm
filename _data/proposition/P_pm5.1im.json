  "remarks" : " Two propositions are equivalent if they are both true.  Closed form of ~ 2th .  Equivalent to a ~ bi1 -like version of the xor-connective.  This theorem stays true, no matter how you permute its operands.  This is evident from its sharper version ` ( ph <-> ( ps <-> ( ph <-> ps ) ) ) ` .  (Contributed by Wolf Lammen, 12-May-2013.) ",
