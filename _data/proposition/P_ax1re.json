  "remarks" : " 1 is a real number.  Axiom for real and complex numbers, derived from set theory.  This construction-dependent theorem should not be referenced directly; instead, use ~ ax-1re . In the Metamath Proof Explorer, this is not a complex number axiom but is proved from ~ ax-1cn and the other axioms.  It is not known whether we can do so here, but the Metamath Proof Explorer proof (accessed 13-Jan-2020) uses excluded middle.  (Contributed by Jim Kingdon, 13-Jan-2020.) (New usage is discouraged.)
