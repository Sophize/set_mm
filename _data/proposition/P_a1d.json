  "remarks" : " Deduction introducing an embedded antecedent.  Deduction form of ~ ax-1 .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Jan-1993.)  (Proof shortened by Stefan Allan, 20-Mar-2006.) \n\n---\n\n Deduction introducing an embedded antecedent.  (The proof was revised by Stefan Allan, 20-Mar-2006.) _Naming convention_:  We often call a theorem a \"deduction\" and suffix its label with \"d\" whenever the hypotheses and conclusion are each prefixed with the same antecedent.  This allows us to use the theorem in places where (in traditional textbook formalizations) the standard Deduction Theorem would be used; here ` ph ` would be replaced with a conjunction ( ~ wa ) of the hypotheses of the would-be deduction.  By contrast, we tend to call the simpler version with no common antecedent an \"inference\" and suffix its label with \"i\"; compare theorem ~ a1i . Finally, a \"theorem\" would be the form with no hypotheses; in this case the \"theorem\" form would be the original axiom ~ ax-1 .  We usually show the theorem form without a suffix on its label (e.g. ~ pm2.43 vs. ~ pm2.43i vs. ~ pm2.43d ).  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)  (Revised by NM, 20-Mar-2006.) ",
