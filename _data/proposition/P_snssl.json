  "remarks" : " If a singleton is a subclass of another class, then the singleton's element is an element of that other class.  This theorem is the right-to-left implication of the biconditional ~ snss .  The proof of this theorem was automatically generated from ~ snsslVD using a tools command file, translateMWO.cmd , by translating the proof into its non-virtual deduction form and minimizing it.  (Contributed by Alan Sare, 25-Aug-2011.)  (Proof modification is discouraged.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
