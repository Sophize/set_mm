  "remarks" : " The sequence ` NN ` , ` NN0 ` , and ` ZZ ` forms a chain of proper subsets.  In each case the proper subset relationship is shown by demonstrating a number that belongs to one set but not the other.  We show that zero belongs to ` NN0 ` but not ` NN ` and minus one belongs to ` ZZ ` but not ` NN0 ` .  This theorem refines the chain of proper subsets ~ nthruc .  (Contributed by NM, 9-May-2004.) ",
