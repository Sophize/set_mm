  "remarks" : " The Null Set Axiom of ZF set theory: there exists a set with no elements.  Axiom of Empty Set of [Enderton] p. 18.  In some textbooks, this is presented as a separate axiom; here we show it can be derived from Separation ~ ax-sep .  This version of the Null Set Axiom tells us that at least one empty set exists, but does not tell us that it is unique - we need the Axiom of Extensionality to do that (see ~ zfnuleu ). This proof, suggested by Jeff Hoffman, uses only ~ ax-4 and ~ ax-gen from predicate calculus, which are valid in \"free logic\" i.e. logic holding in an empty domain (see Axiom A5 and Rule R2 of [LeBlanc] p. 277).  Thus, our ~ ax-sep implies the existence of at least one set. Note that Kunen's version of ~ ax-sep (Axiom 3 of [Kunen] p. 11) does not imply the existence of a set because his is universally closed i.e. prefixed with universal quantifiers to eliminate all free variables. His existence is provided by a separate axiom stating ` E. x x = x ` (Axiom 0 of [Kunen] p. 10). See ~ axnulALT for a proof directly from ~ ax-rep . This theorem should not be referenced by any proof.  Instead, use ~ ax-nul below so that the uses of the Null Set Axiom can be more easily identified.  (Contributed by Jeff Hoffman, 3-Feb-2008.)
