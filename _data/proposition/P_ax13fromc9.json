This proof uses newer axioms ~ ax-4 and ~ ax-6 , but since these are proved from the older axioms above, this is acceptable and lets us avoid having to reprove several earlier theorems to use ~ ax-c4 and ~ ax-c10 . (Contributed by NM, 21-Dec-2015.)  (Proof modification is discouraged.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
