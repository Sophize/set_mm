  "remarks" : " Principle of Transfinite Recursion, part 1 of 3.  Theorem 7.41(1) of [TakeutiZaring] p. 47.  We start with an arbitrary class ` G ` , normally a function, and define a class ` A ` of all \"acceptable\" functions.  The final function we're interested in is the union ` F = recs ( G ) ` of them. ` F ` is then said to be defined by transfinite recursion.  The purpose of the 3 parts of this theorem is to demonstrate properties of ` F ` .  In this first part we show that ` F ` is a function whose domain is all ordinal numbers.
