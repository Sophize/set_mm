  "remarks" : " Axiom of Quantifier Substitution.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Appears as Lemma L12 in [Megill] p. 445 (p. 12 of the preprint). The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-10o (\"o\" for \"old\") and was replaced with this shorter ~ ax-10 in May 2008.  The old axiom is proved from this one as theorem ~ ax10o .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from ~ ax-10o as theorem ~ ax10 .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) ",
