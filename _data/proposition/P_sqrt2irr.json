  "remarks" : " The square root of 2 is irrational.  See ~ zsqrtelqelz for a generalization to all non-square integers.  The proof's core is proven in ~ sqr2irrlem , which shows that if ` A / B = sqrt ( 2 ) ` , then ` A ` and ` B ` are even, so ` A / 2 ` and ` B / 2 ` are smaller representatives, which is absurd.  An older version of this proof was included in _The Seventeen Provers of the World_ compiled by Freek Wiedijk.  It is also the first \"top 100\" mathematical theorems whose formalization is tracked by Freek Wiedijk on his _Formalizing 100 Theorems_ page at ~ http://www.cs.ru.nl/~~freek/100/ .
