  "remarks" : " Division restricted to ` ZZ X. NN ` is a function.  Given excluded middle, it would be easy to prove this for ` CC X. ( CC \\ { 0 } ) ` . The key difference is that an element of ` NN ` is apart from zero, whereas being an element of ` CC \\ { 0 } ` implies being not equal to zero.  (Contributed by Jim Kingdon, 19-Mar-2020.) ",
