  "remarks" : " Axiom ~ ax-c15 was the original version of ~ ax-12 , before it was discovered (in Jan. 2007) that the shorter ~ ax-12 could replace it.  It appears as Axiom scheme C15' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105, from which it can be proved by cases.  To understand this theorem more easily, think of \" ` -. A. x x = y -> ` ...\" as informally meaning \"if ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables then...\"  The antecedent becomes false if the same variable is substituted for ` x ` and ` y ` , ensuring the theorem is sound whenever this is the case.  In some later theorems, we call an antecedent of the form ` -. A. x x = y ` a \"distinctor.\" Interestingly, if the wff expression substituted for ` ph ` contains no wff variables, the resulting statement _can_ be proved without invoking this axiom.  This means that even though this axiom is _metalogically_ independent from the others, it is not _logically_ independent. Specifically, we can prove any wff-variable-free instance of axiom ~ ax-c15 (from which the ~ ax-12 instance follows by theorem ~ ax12 .) The proof is by induction on formula length, using ~ ax12eq and ~ ax12el for the basis steps and ~ ax12indn , ~ ax12indi , and ~ ax12inda for the induction steps.  (This paragraph is true provided we use ~ ax-c11 in place of ~ ax-c11n .) This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used.  It is proved above as theorem ~ axc15 , which should be used instead.  (Contributed by NM, 14-May-1993.)  (New usage is discouraged.) ",
