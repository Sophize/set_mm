  "remarks" : " A couple is never equal to a monuple.  It is in order to have this \"non-clashing\" result that tagging was used.  Without tagging, we would have ` (| A , (/) |) = (| A |) ` .  Note that in the context of Morse tuples, it is natural to define the 0-tuple as the empty set.  Therefore, the present theorem together with ~ bj-1upln0 and ~ bj-2upln0 tell us that an m-tuple may equal an n-tuple only when m = n, at least for m, n <= 2, but this result would extend as soon as we define n-tuples for higher values of n.
