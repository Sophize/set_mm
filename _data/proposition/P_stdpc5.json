  "remarks" : " An axiom scheme of standard predicate calculus that emulates Axiom 5 of [Mendelson] p. 69.  The hypothesis ` F/ x ph ` can be thought of as emulating \" ` x ` is not free in ` ph ` .\"  With this definition, the meaning of \"not free\" is less restrictive than the usual textbook definition; for example ` x ` would not (for us) be free in ` x = x ` by ~ nfequid .  This theorem scheme can be proved as a metatheorem of Mendelson's axiom system, even though it is slightly stronger than his Axiom 5.  See ~ stdpc5v for a version requiring fewer axioms.
