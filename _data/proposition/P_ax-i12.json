  "remarks" : " Axiom of Quantifier Introduction.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Informally, it says that whenever ` z ` is distinct from ` x ` and ` y ` , and ` x = y ` is true, then ` x = y ` quantified with ` z ` is also true.  In other words, ` z ` is irrelevant to the truth of ` x = y ` .  Axiom scheme C9' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  It apparently does not otherwise appear in the literature but is easily proved from textbook predicate calculus by cases. This axiom has been modified from the original ~ ax-12 for compatibility with intuitionistic logic.  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 31-Jan-2015.) ",
