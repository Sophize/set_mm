Proofs, such as this one, which assume a proposition, here ` ph ` , derive a contradiction, and therefore conclude ` -. ph ` , are valid intuitionistically (and can be called \"proof of negation\", for example by Section 1.2 of [Bauer] p. 482).  By contrast, proofs which assume ` -. ph ` , derive a contradiction, and conclude ` ph ` , such as ~ condandc , are only valid for decidable propositions.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)
