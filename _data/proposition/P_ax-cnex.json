This axiom is redundant - see ~ cnexALT - but we provide this axiom because the justification theorem ~ axcnex does not use ~ ax-rep even though the redundancy proof does.  Proofs should normally use ~ cnex instead.  (New usage is discouraged.)  (Contributed by NM, 1-Mar-1995.) \n\n---\n\n The complex numbers form a set.  Proofs should normally use ~ cnex instead.
