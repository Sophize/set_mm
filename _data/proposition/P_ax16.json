  "remarks" : " Theorem showing that ~ ax-16 is redundant if ~ ax-17 is included in the axiom system.  The important part of the proof is provided by ~ aev . See ~ ax16ALT for an alternate proof that does not require ~ ax-10 or ~ ax-12 . This theorem should not be referenced in any proof.  Instead, use ~ ax-16 below so that theorems needing ~ ax-16 can be more easily identified.  (Contributed by NM, 8-Nov-2006.) ",
