  "remarks" : " In this proof, the use of the syntactic theorem ~ bj-0 allows to reduce the length of the proof by one (non-essential) step.  Since ~ bj-0 is used in a non-essential step, this use does not appear in the html page (but the present theorem appears on the html page of ~ bj-0 as a theorem using it. Suppose that the syntactic theorem thm0 proves that PHI is a formula, and that thm0 is used to shorten the proof of thm1.  Assume that PHI does have proper non-atomic subformulas of type wff (which is not the case of the formula proved by ~ weq or ~ wel ).  Then, the proof of thm1 does not construct all the proper non-atomic subformulas of PHI (if it did, then using thm0 would not shorten it).  Therefore, thm1 is a special instance of a more general theorem with essentially the same proof.  This explains why syntactic theorems are not useful in set.mm.  In the present case, ~ bj-1 is a special instance of ~ id .  (Contributed by BJ, 24-Sep-2019.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
