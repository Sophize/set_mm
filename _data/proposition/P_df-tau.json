  "remarks" : " Define tau = 6.283185..., which is the smallest positive real number whose cosine is one.  Various notations have been used or proposed for this number including ` _tau ` , a three-legged variant of ` _pi ` , or ` 2 _pi ` .  Note the difference between this constant ` _tau ` and the variable ` ta ` which is a variable representing a propositional logic formula.  Only the latter is italic, and the colors are different.  (We use the inverse of less-than, \" ` ``' < ` \", to turn supremum into infimum; currently we don't have infimum defined separately.) (Contributed by Jim Kingdon, 9-Apr-2018.) ",
