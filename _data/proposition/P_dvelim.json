  "remarks" : " This theorem can be used to eliminate a distinct variable restriction on ` x ` and ` z ` and replace it with the \"distinctor\" ` -. A. x x = y ` as an antecedent. ` ph ` normally has ` z ` free and can be read ` ph ( z ) ` , and ` ps ` substitutes ` y ` for ` z ` and can be read ` ph ( y ) ` .  We do not require that ` x ` and ` y ` be distinct: if they are not, the distinctor will become false (in multiple-element domains of discourse) and \"protect\" the consequent. To obtain a closed-theorem form of this inference, prefix the hypotheses with ` A. x A. z ` , conjoin them, and apply ~ dvelimdf . Other variants of this theorem are ~ dvelimh (with no distinct variable restrictions) and ~ dvelimhw (that avoids ~ ax-13 ).
