  "remarks" : " A set is Ia-finite iff it is not the union of two I-infinite sets. Equivalent to definition Ia of [Levy58] p. 2.  A I-infinite Ia-finite set is also known as an amorphous set.  This is the second of Levy's eight definitions of finite set.  Levy's I-finite is equivalent to our ~ df-fin and not repeated here.  These eight definitions are equivalent with Choice but strictly decreasing in strength in models where Choice fails; conversely, they provide a series of increasingly stronger notions of infiniteness.
