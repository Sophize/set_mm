  "remarks" : " Define the bra of a vector used by Dirac notation.  Based on definition of bra in [Prugovecki] p. 186 (p. 180 in 1971 edition).  In Dirac bra-ket notation, ` <. A | B >. ` is a complex number equal to the inner product ` ( B .ih A ) ` .  But physicists like to talk about the individual components ` <. A | ` and ` | B >. ` , called bra and ket respectively.  In order for their properties to make sense formally, we define the ket ` | B >. ` as the vector ` B ` itself, and the bra ` <. A | ` as a functional from ` ~H ` to ` CC ` .  We represent the Dirac notation ` <. A | B >. ` by ` ( ( bra `` A ) `` B ) ` ; see ~ braval .  The reversal of the inner product arguments not only makes the bra-ket behavior consistent with physics literature (see comments under ~ ax-his3 ) but is also required in order for the associative law ~ kbass2 to work. Our definition of bra and the associated outer product ~ df-kb differs from, but is equivalent to, a common approach in the literature that makes use of mappings to a dual space.  Our approach eliminates the need to have a parallel development of this dual space and instead keeps everything in Hilbert space. _For an extensive discussion about how our notation maps to the bra-ket notation in physics textbooks, see ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmnotes.txt , under the 17-May-2006 entry_.
