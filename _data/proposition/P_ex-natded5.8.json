For information about ND and Metamath, see the <A HREF=\"mmnatded.html\">page on Deduction Form and Natural Deduction in Metamath Proof Explorer</A>.

The Metamath line-for-line translation of this natural deduction approach precedes every line with an antecedent including ` ph ` and uses the Metamath equivalents of the natural deduction rules. To add an assumption, the antecedent is modified to include it (typically by using ~ adantr ; ~ simpr is useful when you want to depend directly on the new assumption). Below is the final metamath proof (which reorders some steps). A much more efficient proof, using more of Metamath and MPE's capabilities, is shown in ~ ex-natded5.8-2 . (Proof modification is discouraged.)  (New usage is discouraged.) (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 9-Feb-2017.) ",
