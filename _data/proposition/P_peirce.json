  "remarks" : " Peirce's axiom.  This odd-looking theorem is the \"difference\" between an intuitionistic system of propositional calculus and a classical system and is not accepted by intuitionists.  When Peirce's axiom is added to an intuitionistic system, the system becomes equivalent to our classical system ~ ax-1 through ~ ax-3 .  A curious fact about this theorem is that it requires ~ ax-3 for its proof even though the result has no negation connectives in it.  (Contributed by NM, 29-Dec-1992.)  (Proof shortened by Wolf Lammen, 9-Oct-2012.) ",
