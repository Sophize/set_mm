  "remarks" : " This theorem expresses two different facts from the two subset implications in this equality.  In the forward direction, it says that the transitive closure has members of every rank below ` A ` .  Stated another way, to construct a set at a given rank, you have to climb the entire hierarchy of ordinals below ` ( rank `` A ) ` , constructing at least one set at each level in order to move up the ranks.  In the reverse direction, it says that every member of ` ( TC `` A ) ` has a rank below the rank of ` A ` , since intuitively it contains only the members of ` A ` and the members of those and so on, but nothing \"bigger\" than ` A ` .
