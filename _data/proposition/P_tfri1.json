  "remarks" : " Principle of Transfinite Recursion, part 1 of 3.  Theorem 7.41(1) of [TakeutiZaring] p. 47, with an additional condition. The condition is that ` G ` is defined \"everywhere\" and here is stated as ` ( G `` x ) e. _V ` .  Alternatively ` A. x e. On A. f ( f Fn x -> f e. dom G ) ` would suffice. Given a function ` G ` satisfying that condition, we define a class ` A ` of all \"acceptable\" functions.  The final function we're interested in is the union ` F = recs ( G ) ` of them. ` F ` is then said to be defined by transfinite recursion.  The purpose of the 3 parts of this theorem is to demonstrate properties of ` F ` .  In this first part we show that ` F ` is a function whose domain is all ordinal numbers.
