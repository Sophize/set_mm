  "remarks" : " The imaginary unit is the square root of negative 1.  A lot of people like to call this the \"definition\" of ` _i ` , but the definition of ` sqrt ` ~ df-sqrt has already been crafted with ` _i ` being mentioned explicitly, and in any case it doesn't make too much sense to define a value based on a function evaluated outside its domain.  A more appropriate view is to take ~ ax-i2m1 or ~ i2 as the \"definition\", and simply postulate the existence of a number satisfying this property.  This is the approach we take here.
