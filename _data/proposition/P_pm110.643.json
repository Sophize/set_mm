  "remarks" : " 1+1=2 for cardinal number addition, derived from ~ pm54.43 as promised. Theorem *110.643 of _Principia Mathematica_, vol.  II, p. 86, which adds the remark, \"The above proposition is occasionally useful.\"  Whitehead and Russell define cardinal addition on collections of all sets equinumerous to 1 and 2 (which for us are proper classes unless we restrict them as in ~ karden ), but after applying definitions, our theorem is equivalent. The comment for ~ cdaval explains why we use ` ~~ ` instead of =.  See ~ pm110.643ALT for a shorter proof that doesn't use ~ pm54.43 . (Contributed by NM, 5-Apr-2007.)  (Proof modification is discouraged.) ",
