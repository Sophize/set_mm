  "remarks" : " We now have prepared everything.  The unwanted variable ` u ` is just in one place left. ~ pm2.61 can be used in conjunction with ~ wl-ax11-lem9 to eliminate the second antecedent.  Missing is something along the lines of ~ ax-6 , so we could remove the first antecedent.  But the Metamath axioms cannot accomplish this.  Such a rule must reside one abstraction level higher than all others:  It says that a distinctor implies a distinct variable condition on its contained setvar.  This is only needed if such conditions are required, as ax-11v does.  The result of this study is for me, that you cannot introduce a setvar capturing this condition, and hope to eliminate it later.
