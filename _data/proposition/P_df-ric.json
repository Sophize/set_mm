  "remarks" : " Define the ring isomorphism relation, analogous to ~ df-gic :  Two (unital) rings are said to be _isomorphic_ iff they are connected by at least one isomorphism.  Isomorphic rings share all global ring properties, but to relate local properties requires knowledge of a specific isomorphism.  (Contributed by AV, 24-Dec-2019.) ",
