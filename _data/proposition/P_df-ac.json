  "remarks" : " The expression ` CHOICE ` will be used as a readable shorthand for any form of the axiom of choice; all concrete forms are long, cryptic, have dummy variables, or all three, making it useful to have a short name. Similar to the Axiom of Choice (first form) of [Enderton] p. 49. There is a slight problem with taking the exact form of ~ ax-ac as our definition, because the equivalence to more standard forms ( ~ dfac2 ) requires the Axiom of Regularity, which we often try to avoid.  Thus, we take the first of the \"textbook forms\" as the definition and derive the form of ~ ax-ac itself as ~ dfac0 .  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 22-Feb-2015.) ",
