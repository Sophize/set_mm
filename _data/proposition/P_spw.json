  "remarks" : " Weak version of the specialization scheme ~ sp .  Lemma 9 of [KalishMontague] p. 87.  While it appears that ~ sp in its general form does not follow from Tarski's FOL axiom schemes, from this theorem we can prove any _instance_ of ~ sp having mutually distinct setvar variables and no wff metavariables (see ~ ax12wdemo for an example of the procedure to eliminate the hypothesis).  Other approximations of ~ sp are ~ spfw (minimal distinct variable requirements), ~ spnfw (when ` x ` is not free in ` -. ph ` ), ~ spvw (when ` x ` does not appear in ` ph ` ), ~ sptruw (when ` ph ` is true), and ~ spfalw (when ` ph ` is false).
