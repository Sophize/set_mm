  "remarks" : " Cantor's Theorem.  No set is equinumerous to its power set. Specifically, any set has a cardinality (size) strictly less than the cardinality of its power set.  For example, the cardinality of real numbers is the same as the cardinality of the power set of integers, so real numbers cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with integers.  Theorem 23 of [Suppes] p. 97.  For the function version, see ~ canth .  This is Metamath 100 proof #63.  (Contributed by NM, 7-Aug-1994.) ",
