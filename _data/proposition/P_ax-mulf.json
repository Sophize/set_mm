  "remarks" : " Multiplication is an operation on the complex numbers.  This deprecated axiom is provided for historical compatibility but is not a bona fide axiom for complex numbers (independent of set theory) since it cannot be interpreted as a first- or second-order statement (see ~ http://us.metamath.org/downloads/schmidt-cnaxioms.pdf ).  It may be deleted in the future and should be avoided for new theorems.  Instead, the less specific ~ ax-mulcl should be used.  Note that uses of ~ ax-mulf can be eliminated by using the defined operation ` ( x e. CC , y e. CC |-> ( x x. y ) ) ` in place of ` x. ` , from which this axiom (with the defined operation in place of ` x. ` ) follows as a theorem. This axiom is justified by theorem ~ axmulf . (New usage is discouraged.)  (Contributed by NM, 19-Oct-2004.) ",
