  "remarks" : " Rederivation of axiom ~ ax-12 from ~ ax-c15 , ~ ax-c11 , and other older axioms.  See theorem ~ axc15 for the derivation of ~ ax-c15 from ~ ax-12 . An open problem is whether we can prove this using ~ ax-c11n instead of ~ ax-c11 . This proof uses newer axioms ~ ax-4 and ~ ax-6 , but since these are proved from the older axioms above, this is acceptable and lets us avoid having to reprove several earlier theorems to use ~ ax-c4 and ~ ax-c10 . (Contributed by NM, 22-Jan-2007.)  (Proof modification is discouraged.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
