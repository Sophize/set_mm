  "remarks" : " Stoic logic Thema 1 (part a). The first thema of the four Stoic logic themata, in its basic form, was: \"When from two (assertibles) a third follows, then from either of them together with the contradictory of the conclusion the contradictory of the other follows.\"  (Apuleius Int. 209.9-14), see [Bobzien] p. 117 and ~ https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ We will represent thema 1 as two very similar rules ~ stoic1a and ~ stoic1b to represent each side.
