  "remarks" : " Define indexed union.  Definition indexed union in [Stoll] p. 45.  In most applications, ` A ` is independent of ` x ` (although this is not required by the definition), and ` B ` depends on ` x ` i.e. can be read informally as ` B ( x ) ` .  We call ` x ` the index, ` A ` the index set, and ` B ` the indexed set.  In most books, ` x e. A ` is written as a subscript or underneath a union symbol ` U. ` .  We use a special union symbol ` U_ ` to make it easier to distinguish from plain class union.  In many theorems, you will see that ` x ` and ` A ` are in the same distinct variable group (meaning ` A ` cannot depend on ` x ` ) and that ` B ` and ` x ` do not share a distinct variable group (meaning that can be thought of as ` B ( x ) ` i.e. can be substituted with a class expression containing ` x ` ).  An alternate definition tying indexed union to ordinary union is ~ dfiun2 .  Theorem ~ uniiun provides a definition of ordinary union in terms of indexed union.  Theorems ~ fniunfv and ~ funiunfv are useful when ` B ` is a function. (Contributed by NM, 27-Jun-1998.) \n\n---\n\n Define indexed union.  Definition indexed union in [Stoll] p. 45.
