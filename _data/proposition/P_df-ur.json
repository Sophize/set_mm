  "remarks" : " Define the multiplicative neutral element of a ring.  This definition works by extracting the ` 0g ` element, i.e. the neutral element in a group or monoid, and transferring it to the multiplicative monoid via the ` mulGrp ` function ( ~ df-mgp ).  See also ~ dfur2 , which derives the \"traditional\" definition as the unique element of a ring which is left- and right-neutral under multiplication.  (Contributed by NM, 27-Aug-2011.)
