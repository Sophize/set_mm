This theorem transfers the associative laws for the real and imaginary signed real components of complex number pairs, to complex number addition itself.  Axiom 9 of 22 for real and complex numbers, derived from ZF set theory.  This construction-dependent theorem should not be referenced directly, nor should the proven axiom ~ ax-addass be used later.  Instead, use ~ addass .  (Contributed by NM, 2-Sep-1995.) (New usage is discouraged.) \n\n---\n\n Addition of complex numbers is associative.
