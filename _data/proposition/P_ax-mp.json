  "remarks" : " Rule of Modus Ponens.  The postulated inference rule of propositional calculus.  See e.g.  Rule 1 of [Hamilton] p. 73.  The rule says, \"if ` ph ` is true, and ` ph ` implies ` ps ` , then ` ps ` must also be true.\"  This rule is sometimes called \"detachment,\" since it detaches the minor premise from the major premise.  \"Modus ponens\" is short for \"modus ponendo ponens,\" a Latin phrase that means \"the mode that by affirming affirms\" - remark in [Sanford] p. 39.  This rule is similar to the rule of modus tollens ~ mto . Note:  In some web page displays such as the Statement List, the symbols \" ` & ` \" and \" ` => ` \" informally indicate the relationship between the hypotheses and the assertion (conclusion), abbreviating the English words \"and\" and \"implies.\"  They are not part of the formal language.
