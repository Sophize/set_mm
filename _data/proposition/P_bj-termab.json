  "remarks" : " Every class can be written as (is equal to) a class abstraction. ~ cvjust is a special instance of it, but the present proof does not require ~ ax-13 , contrary to ~ cvjust .  This theorem requires ~ ax-ext , ~ df-clab , ~ df-cleq , ~ df-clel , but to prove that any specific class term not containing class variables is a setvar or can be written as (is equal to) a class abstraction does not require these $a-statements.  This last fact is a metatheorem, consequence of the fact that the only $a-statements with typecode ` class ` are ~ cv , ~ cab and statements corresponding to defined class constructors.  UPDATE: it is (almost) ~ abid2 and ~ bj-abid2 , though the present proof is shorter than a proof from ~ bj-abid2 and ~ eqcomi (and is shorter than the proof of either) ; plus, it is of the same form as ~ cvjust and such a basic statement deserves to be present in both forms.  Note that ~ bj-termab shortens the proof of ~ abid2 , and shortens five proofs by a total of 72 bytes.  Move it to main as \"abid1\"?  (Contributed by BJ, 21-Oct-2019.)
