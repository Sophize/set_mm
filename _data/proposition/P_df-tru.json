  "remarks" : " Definition of the truth value \"true\", or \"verum\", denoted by ` T. ` . This is a tautology, as proved by ~ tru .  In this definition, an instance of ~ id is used as the definiens, although any tautology, such as an axiom, can be used in its place.  This particular ~ id instance was chosen so this definition can be checked by the same algorithm that is used for predicate calculus.  This definition should be referenced directly only by ~ tru , and other proofs should depend on ~ tru (directly or indirectly) instead of this definition, since there are many alternative ways to define ` T. ` .
