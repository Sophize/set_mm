  "remarks" : " 0 is less than 1.  Axiom for real and complex numbers, derived from set theory.  This construction-dependent theorem should not be referenced directly; instead, use ~ ax-0lt1 . The version of this axiom in the Metamath Proof Explorer reads ` 1 =/= 0 ` ; here we change it to ` 0 <RR 1 ` .  The proof of ` 0 <RR 1 ` from ` 1 =/= 0 ` in the Metamath Proof Explorer (accessed 12-Jan-2020) relies on real number trichotomy.  (Contributed by Jim Kingdon, 12-Jan-2020.)  (New usage is discouraged.) ",
