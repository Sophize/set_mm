  "remarks" : " Axiom of Existence.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  This axiom tells us is that at least one thing exists.  In this form (not requiring that ` x ` and ` y ` be distinct) it was used in an axiom system of Tarski (see Axiom B7' in footnote 1 of [KalishMontague] p. 81.)  It is equivalent to axiom scheme C10' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint); the equivalence is established by ~ axc10 and ~ ax6fromc10 .  A more convenient form of this axiom is ~ ax6e , which has additional remarks. Raph Levien proved the independence of this axiom from the other logical axioms on 12-Apr-2005.  See item 16 at ~ http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html . ~ ax-6 can be proved from the weaker version ~ ax6v requiring that the variables be distinct; see theorem ~ ax6 . ~ ax-6 can also be proved from the Axiom of Separation (in the form that we use that axiom, where free variables are not universally quantified). See theorem ~ ax6vsep . Except by ~ ax6v , this axiom should not be referenced directly.  Instead, use theorem ~ ax6 .  (Contributed by NM, 10-Jan-1993.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
