  "remarks" : " Modus tollendo ponens (inclusive-or version), aka disjunctive syllogism.  This is similar to ~ mtp-xor , one of the five original \"indemonstrables\" in Stoic logic.  However, in Stoic logic this rule used exclusive-or, while the name modus tollendo ponens often refers to a variant of the rule that uses inclusive-or instead.  The rule says, \"if ` ph ` is not true, and ` ph ` or ` ps ` (or both) are true, then ` ps ` must be true.\"  An alternative phrasing is, \"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\" -- Sherlock Holmes (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 1890:  The Sign of the Four, ch. 6).
