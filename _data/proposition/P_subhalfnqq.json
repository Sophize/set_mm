  "remarks" : " There is a number which is less than half of any positive fraction.  The case where ` A ` is one is Lemma 11.4 of [BauerTaylor], p. 50, and they use the word \"approximate half\" for such a number (since there may be constructions, for some structures other than the rationals themselves, which rely on such an approximate half but do not require division by two as seen at ~ halfnqq ).
