  "remarks" : " Axiom of Existence.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  One thing this axiom tells us is that at least one thing exists (although ~ ax-4 and possibly others also tell us that, i.e. they are not valid in the empty domain of a \"free logic\"). In this form (not requiring that ` x ` and ` y ` be distinct) it was used in an axiom system of Tarski (see Axiom B7' in footnote 1 of [KalishMontague] p. 81.)  Another name for this theorem is ~ a9e , which has additional remarks.  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 31-Jan-2015.) ",
