  "remarks" : " The decimal form of 10.  NB:  In our presentations of large numbers later on, we will use our symbol for 10 at the highest digits when advantageous, because we can use this theorem to convert back to \"long form\" (where each digit is in the range 0-9) with no extra effort.  However, we _cannot_ do this for lower digits while maintaining the ease of use of the decimal system, since it requires nontrivial number knowledge (more than just equality theorems) to convert back.
