  "remarks" : " Theorem showing that ~ ax-6 follows from the weaker version ~ ax6v . (Even though this theorem depends on ~ ax-6 , all references of ~ ax-6 are made via ~ ax6v .  An earlier version stated ~ ax6v as a separate axiom, but having two axioms caused some confusion.) This theorem should be referenced in place of ~ ax-6 so that all proofs can be traced back to ~ ax6v .  (Contributed by NM, 12-Nov-2013.) (Revised by NM, 25-Jul-2015.)  (Proof shortened by Wolf Lammen, 4-Feb-2018.) ",
