  "remarks" : " Remove from ~ isseti dependency on ~ ax-ext (and on ~ df-cleq and ~ df-v ).  This proof uses only ~ df-clab and ~ df-clel on top of first-order logic.  It only uses ~ ax-12 among the auxiliary logical axioms.  The hypothesis uses ` V ` instead of ` _V ` for extra generality.  This is indeed more general as long as ~ elex is not available.  Use ~ bj-issetiv instead when sufficient (in particular when ` V ` is substituted for ` _V ` ).  (Contributed by BJ, 13-Jun-2019.) (Proof modification is discouraged.) ",
