  "remarks" : " Alternate definition of the \"semantically non-free\" predicate, equivalent to ~ df-nf by ~ nf2 .  This definition is stricter than ~ df-nf as soon as one has ~ sp , and less strict as soon as one has ~ ax-10 .  This version has no nested quantifiers, so is easier to understand and easier to handle when ~ ax-10 is not yet available, as illustrated by the results below (see ~ bj-nfbi ~ bj-nfn ).
