  "remarks" : " Define the function mapping a graph to the set of its vertices.  This definition is very general:  It defines the set of vertices for any ordered pair as its first component.  Therefore, this definition has no special meaning, except to give the first component of a graph its intended name.  (Contributed by AV, 9-Jan-2020.) ",
