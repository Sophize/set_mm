  "remarks" : " Show what implication inside \"there exists\" really expands to (using implication directly inside \"there exists\" is usually a mistake). Those inexperienced with formal notations of classical logic may use expressions combining \"there exists\" with implication.  That is usually a mistake, because as proven using ~ imor , such an expression can be rewritten using _not_ with _or_ - and that is often not what the author intended.  New users of formal notation who use \"there exists\" with an implication should consider if they meant \"and\" instead of \"implies\".  A stark example is shown in ~ eximp-surprise2 .  See also ~ alimp-surprise and ~ empty-surprise .  (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 17-Oct-2018.) ",
