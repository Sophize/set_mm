  "remarks" : " Define the value of an operation.  Definition of operation value in [Enderton] p. 79.  Note that the syntax is simply three class expressions in a row bracketed by parentheses.  There are no restrictions of any kind on what those class expressions may be, although only certain kinds of class expressions - a binary operation ` F ` and its arguments ` A ` and ` B ` - will be useful for proving meaningful theorems.  For example, if class ` F ` is the operation ` + ` and arguments ` A ` and ` B ` are ` 3 ` and ` 2 ` , the expression ` ( 3 + 2 ) ` can be proved to equal ` 5 ` (see ~ 3p2e5 ).  This definition is well-defined, although not very meaningful, when classes ` A ` and/or ` B ` are proper classes (i.e. are not sets); see ~ ovprc1 and ~ ovprc2 .  On the other hand, we often find uses for this definition when ` F ` is a proper class, such as ` +o ` in ~ oav . ` F ` is normally equal to a class of nested ordered pairs of the form defined by ~ df-oprab .
