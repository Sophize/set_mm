  "remarks" : " Version of ~ 19.21 with a dv condition. _Notational convention_:  We sometimes suffix with \"v\" the label of a theorem using a distinct variable (\"dv\") condition instead of a non-freeness hypothesis such as ` F/ x ph ` .  Conversely, we sometimes suffix with \"f\" the label of a theorem introducing such a non-freeness hypothesis (\"f\" stands for \"not free in\", see ~ df-nf ) instead of a dv condition.  For instance, ~ 19.21v versus ~ 19.21 and ~ vtoclf versus ~ vtocl .  Note that \"not free in\" is less restrictive than \"does not occur in.\"  Note that the version with a dv condition is easily proved from the version with the corresponding non-freeness hypothesis, by using ~ nfv .  However, the dv version can often be proved from fewer axioms.  (Contributed by NM, 21-Jun-1993.)  Reduce dependencies on axioms.  (Revised by Wolf Lammen, 2-Jan-2020.) \n\n---\n\n Special case of Theorem 19.21 of [Margaris] p. 90. _Notational convention_:  We sometimes suffix with \"v\" the label of a theorem eliminating a hypothesis such as ` ( ph -> A. x ph ) ` in ~ 19.21 via the use of distinct variable conditions combined with ~ ax-17 . Conversely, we sometimes suffix with \"f\" the label of a theorem introducing such a hypothesis to eliminate the need for the distinct variable condition; e.g. ~ euf derived from ~ df-eu .  The \"f\" stands for \"not free in\" which is less restrictive than \"does not occur in.\" (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) ",
