  "remarks" : " ` _pi ` is greater or equal to 3.  This proof is based on the geometric observation that a hexagon of unit side length has perimeter 6, which is less than the unit-radius circumcircle, of perimeter ` 2 _pi ` .  We translate this to algebra by looking at the function ` _e ^ ( _i x ) ` as ` x ` goes from ` 0 ` to ` _pi / 3 ` ; it moves at unit speed and travels distance ` 1 ` , hence ` 1 <_ _pi / 3 ` .
