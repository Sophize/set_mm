  "remarks" : " Modus tollendo ponens (original exclusive-or version), aka disjunctive syllogism, similar to ~ mtpor , one of the five \"indemonstrables\" in Stoic logic.  The rule says, \"if ` ph ` is not true, and either ` ph ` or ` ps ` (exclusively) are true, then ` ps ` must be true.\"  Today the name \"modus tollendo ponens\" often refers to a variant, the inclusive-or version as defined in ~ mtpor .  See rule 3 on [Lopez-Astorga] p. 12 (note that the \"or\" is the same as ~ mptxor , that is, it is exclusive-or ~ df-xor ), rule 3 of [Sanford] p. 39 (where it is not as clearly stated which kind of \"or\" is used but it appears to be in the same sense as ~ mptxor ), and rule A5 in [Hitchcock] p. 5 (exclusive-or is expressly used).
