  "remarks" : " Law of excluded middle, for a decidable proposition.  The law of the excluded middle is also called the principle of _tertium non datur_. Theorem *2.11 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 101.  It says that something is either true or not true; there are no in-between values of truth.  The key way in which intuitionistic logic differs from classical logic is that intuitionistic logic says that excluded middle only holds for some propositions, and classical logic says that it holds for all propositions.
