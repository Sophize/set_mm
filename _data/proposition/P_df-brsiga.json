  "remarks" : " A Borel Algebra is defined as a sigma algebra generated by a topology. 'The' Borel sigma algebra here refers to the sigma algebra generated by the topology of open intervals on real numbers.  The Borel algebra of a given topology ` J ` is the sigma-algebra generated by ` J ` , ` ( sigaGen `` J ) ` , so there is no need to introduce a special constant function for Borel sigma Algebra.
