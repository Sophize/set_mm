  "remarks" : " Every set is a class.  Proposition 4.9 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 13.  This theorem shows that a setvar variable can be expressed as a class abstraction.  This provides a motivation for the class syntax construction ~ cv , which allows us to substitute a setvar variable for a class variable.  See also ~ cab and ~ df-clab .  Note that this is not a rigorous justification, because ~ cv is used as part of the proof of this theorem, but a careful argument can be made outside of the formalism of Metamath, for example as is done in Chapter 4 of Takeuti and Zaring.  See also the discussion under the definition of class in [Jech] p. 4 showing that \"Every set can be considered to be a class.\" (Contributed by NM, 7-Nov-2006.) ",
