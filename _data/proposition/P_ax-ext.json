  "remarks" : " Axiom of Extensionality.  An axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.  It states that two sets are identical if they contain the same elements. Axiom Ext of [BellMachover] p. 461. Set theory can also be formulated with a _single_ primitive predicate ` e. ` on top of traditional predicate calculus _without_ equality.  In that case the Axiom of Extensionality becomes ` ( A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) -> ( x e. z -> y e. z ) ) ` , and equality ` x = y ` is _defined_ as ` A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) ` .  All of the usual axioms of equality then become theorems of set theory. See, for example, Axiom 1 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 8. To use the above \"equality-free\" version of Extensionality with Metamath's logical axioms, we would rewrite ~ ax-7 through ~ ax-9 with equality expanded according to the above definition.  Some of those axioms could be proved from set theory and would be redundant.  Not all of them are redundant, since our axioms of predicate calculus make essential use of equality for the proper substitution that is a primitive notion in traditional predicate calculus.  A study of such an axiomatization would be an interesting project for someone exploring the foundations of logic. _General remarks_:  Our set theory axioms are presented using defined connectives ( ` <-> ` , ` E. ` , etc.) for convenience.  However, it is implicitly understood that the actual axioms use only the primitive connectives ` -> ` , ` -. ` , ` A. ` , ` = ` , and ` e. ` .  It is straightforward to establish the equivalence between the actual axioms and the ones we display, and we will not do so. It is important to understand that strictly speaking, all of our set theory axioms are really schemes that represent an infinite number of actual axioms.  This is inherent in the design of Metamath (\"metavariable math\"), which manipulates only metavariables.  For example, the metavariable ` x ` in ~ ax-ext can represent any actual variable _v1_, _v2_, _v3_,... .  Distinct variable restrictions ($d) prevent us from substituting say _v1_ for both ` x ` and ` z ` .  This is in contrast to typical textbook presentations that present actual axioms (except for Replacement ~ ax-rep , which involves a wff metavariable).  In practice, though, the theorems and proofs are essentially the same.  The $d restrictions make each of the infinite axioms generated by the ~ ax-ext scheme exactly logically equivalent to each other and in particular to the actual axiom of the textbook version.
