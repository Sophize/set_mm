  "remarks" : " Exponential growth and decay model.  The derivative of a function _y_ of variable _t_ equals a constant _k_ times _y_ itself, iff _y_ equals some constant _C_ times the exponential of _kt_.  This theorem and ~ expgrowthi illustrate one of the simplest and most crucial classes of _differential equations_, equations that relate functions to their derivatives. Section 6.3 of [Strang] p. 242 calls _y_' = _ky_ \"the most important differential equation in applied mathematics\".  In the field of population ecology it is known as the _Malthusian growth model_ or _exponential law_, and _C_, _k_, and _t_ correspond to initial population size, growth rate, and time respectively ( ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_growth_model ); and in finance, the model appears in a similar role in _continuous compounding_ with _C_ as the initial amount of money.  In _exponential decay_ models, _k_ is often expressed as the negative of a positive constant &lambda;. Here _y_' is given as ` ( S _D Y ) ` , _C_ as ` c ` , and _ky_ as ` ( ( S X. { K } ) oF x. Y ) ` . ` ( S X. { K } ) ` is the constant function that maps any real or complex input to _k_ and ` oF x. ` is multiplication as a function operation. The leftward direction of the biconditional is as given in ~ http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/MA221-2.1.1.pdf pp. 1-2, which also notes the reverse direction (\"While we will not prove this here, it turns out that these are the only functions that satisfy this equation.\").  The rightward direction is Theorem 5.1 of [LarsonHostetlerEdwards] p. 375 (which notes \" _C_ is the _initial value_ of _y_, and _k_ is the _proportionality constant_. _Exponential growth_ occurs when _k_ > 0, and _exponential decay_ occurs when _k_ < 0.\"); its proof here closely follows the proof of _y_' = _y_ in ~ https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Exponential_Growth_Equation/Special_Case . Statements for this and ~ expgrowthi formulated by Mario Carneiro. (Contributed by Steve Rodriguez, 24-Nov-2015.) ",
