  "remarks" : " Axiom of Left Equality for Binary Predicate.  One of the equality and substitution axioms for a non-logical predicate in our predicate calculus with equality.  It substitutes equal variables into the left-hand side of an arbitrary binary predicate ` e. ` , which we will use for the set membership relation when set theory is introduced.  This axiom scheme is a sub-scheme of Axiom Scheme B8 of system S2 of [Tarski], p. 75, whose general form cannot be represented with our notation.  Also appears as Axiom scheme C12' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). \"Non-logical\" means that the predicate is not a primitive of predicate calculus proper but instead is an extension to it.  \"Binary\" means that the predicate has two arguments.  In a system of predicate calculus with equality, like ours, equality is not usually considered to be a non-logical predicate.  In systems of predicate calculus without equality, it typically would be.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Jun-1993.) ",
