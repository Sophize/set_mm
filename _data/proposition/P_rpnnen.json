  "remarks" : " The cardinality of the continuum is the same as the powerset of ` _om ` .  This is a stronger statement than ~ ruc , which only asserts that ` RR ` is uncountable, i.e. has a cardinality larger than ` _om ` .  The main proof is in two parts, ~ rpnnen1 and ~ rpnnen2 , each showing an injection in one direction, and this last part uses ~ sbth to prove that the sets are equinumerous.  By constructing explicit injections, we avoid the use of AC. (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 13-May-2013.)  (Revised by Mario Carneiro, 23-Aug-2014.) ",
