  "remarks" : " A class is a subclass of the union of its power class.  This theorem is the right-to-left subclass lemma of ~ unipw .  The proof of this theorem was automatically generated from ~ unipwrVD using a tools command file , translateMWO.cmd , by translating the proof into its non-virtual deduction form and minimizing it.  (Contributed by Alan Sare, 25-Aug-2011.)  (Proof modification is discouraged.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
