  "remarks" : " Axiom of Distinctness.  This axiom quantifies a variable over a formula in which it does not occur.  Axiom C5 in [Megill] p. 444 (p. 11 of the preprint).  Also appears as Axiom B6 (p. 75) of system S2 of [Tarski] p. 77 and Axiom C5-1 of [Monk2] p. 113. (See comments in ~ ax5ALT about the logical redundancy of ~ ax-5 in the presence of our obsolete axioms.) This axiom essentially says that if ` x ` does not occur in ` ph ` , i.e. ` ph ` does not depend on ` x ` in any way, then we can add the quantifier ` A. x ` to ` ph ` with no further assumptions.  By ~ sp , we can also remove the quantifier (unconditionally).  (Contributed by NM, 10-Jan-1993.) ",
