  "remarks" : " Define the _Moore closure_ of a generating set, which is the smallest closed set containing all generating elements.  Definition of Moore closure in [Schechter] p. 79.  This generalizes topological closure ( ~ mrccls ) and linear span ( ~ mrclsp ). A Moore closure operation ` N ` is (1) extensive, i.e., ` x C_ ( N `` x ) ` for all subsets ` x ` of the base set ( ~ mrcssid ), (2) isotone, i.e., ` x C_ y ` implies that ` ( N `` x ) C_ ( N `` y ) ` for all subsets ` x ` and ` y ` of the base set ( ~ mrcss ), and (3) idempotent, i.e., ` ( N `` ( N `` x ) ) = ( N `` x ) ` for all subsets ` x ` of the base set ( ~ mrcidm .)  Operators satisfying these three properties are in bijective correspondence with Moore collections, so these properties may be used to give an alternate characterization of a Moore collection by providing a closure operation ` N ` on the set of subsets of a given base set which satisfies (1), (2), and (3); the closed sets can be recovered as those sets which equal their closures (Section 4.5 in [Schechter] p. 82.)
