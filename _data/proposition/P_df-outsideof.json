  "remarks" : " The outside of relationship.  This relationship expresses that ` P ` , ` A ` , and ` B ` fall on a line, but ` P ` is not on the segment ` A B ` .  This definition is taken from theorem 6.4 of [Schwabhauser] p. 43, since it requires no dummy variables.  (Contributed by Scott Fenton, 17-Oct-2013.) ",
