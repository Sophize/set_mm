  "remarks" : " Define the function mapping a graph to its order.  This definition is very general:  It defines the order for any ordered pair as the size of its first component.  In the definition of [Bollobas] p. 3, there is no special symbol for the order of a graph G, it is simply denoted by |G| and defined by |G| = |V(G)|, which corresponds to our definition, see ~ gordopval : ` ( GrOrder `` <.
