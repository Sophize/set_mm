It is normally not referenced in the final version of a proof, since it is always redundant and can be removed using the 'minimize *' command in the metamath program's Proof Assistant. Contrary to its closed form ~ id , it requires no axioms for its proof. (Contributed by Alan Sare, 31-Dec-2011.) \n\n---\n\n Inference form of ~ id .
