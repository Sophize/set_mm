  "remarks" : " Two ways to say \" ` A ` is a set\":  A class ` A ` is a member of the universal class ` _V ` (see ~ df-v ) if and only if the class ` A ` exists (i.e. there exists some set ` x ` equal to class ` A ` ). Theorem 6.9 of [Quine] p. 43. _Notational convention_:  We will use the notational device \" ` A e. _V ` \" to mean \" ` A ` is a set\" very frequently, for example in ~ uniex .  Note the when ` A ` is not a set, it is called a proper class.  In some theorems, such as ~ uniexg , in order to shorten certain proofs we use the more general antecedent ` A e. V ` instead of ` A e. _V ` to mean \" ` A ` is a set.\" Note that a constant is implicitly considered distinct from all variables.  This is why ` _V ` is not included in the distinct variable list, even though ~ df-clel requires that the expression substituted for ` B ` not contain ` x ` .  (Also, the Metamath spec does not allow constants in the distinct variable list.)
