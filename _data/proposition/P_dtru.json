  "remarks" : " At least two sets exist (or in terms of first-order logic, the universe of discourse has two or more objects).  Note that we may not substitute the same variable for both ` x ` and ` y ` (as indicated by the distinct variable requirement), for otherwise we would contradict ~ stdpc6 . This theorem is proved directly from set theory axioms (no set theory definitions) and does not use ~ ax-ext or ~ ax-sep .  See ~ dtruALT for a shorter proof using these axioms. The proof makes use of dummy variables ` z ` and ` w ` which do not appear in the final theorem.  They must be distinct from each other and from ` x ` and ` y ` .  In other words, if we were to substitute ` x ` for ` z ` throughout the proof, the proof would fail.
