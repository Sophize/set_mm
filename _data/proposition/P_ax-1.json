  "remarks" : " Axiom _Simp_.  Axiom A1 of [Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of propositional calculus.  The 3 axioms are also given as Definition 2.1 of [Hamilton] p. 28.  This axiom is called _Simp_ or \"the principle of simplification\" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.02 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 100) because \"it enables us to pass from the joint assertion of ` ph ` and ` ps ` to the assertion of ` ph ` simply.\"  It is Proposition 1 of [Frege1879] p. 26, its first axiom.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.) \n\n---\n\n Axiom _Simp_.  Axiom A1 of [Margaris] p. 49.  One of the axioms of propositional calculus.

Although classical propositional logic tautologies can be proved using truth tables, there is no similarly simple system for intuitionistic propositional logic, so proving tautologies from axioms is the preferred approach.
