  "remarks" : " A stronger version of ~ df-id that doesn't require ` x ` and ` y ` to be distinct.  Ordinarily, we wouldn't use this as a definition, since non-distinct dummy variables would make soundness verification more difficult (as the proof here shows).  The proof can be instructive in showing how distinct variable requirements may be eliminated, a task that is not necessarily obvious.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Feb-2008.)
