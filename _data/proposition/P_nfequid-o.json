  "remarks" : " Bound-variable hypothesis builder for ` x = x ` .  This theorem tells us that any variable, including ` x ` , is effectively not free in ` x = x ` , even though ` x ` is technically free according to the traditional definition of free variable.  (The proof uses only ~ ax-4 , ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-c9 , and ~ ax-gen .  This shows that this can be proved without ~ ax6 , even though the theorem ~ equid cannot be.  A shorter proof using ~ ax6 is obtainable from ~ equid and ~ hbth .)  Remark added 2-Dec-2015 NM:  This proof does implicitly use ~ ax6v , which is used for the derivation of ~ axc9 , unless we consider ~ ax-c9 the starting axiom rather than ~ ax-13 .  (Contributed by NM, 13-Jan-2011.)  (Revised by Mario Carneiro, 12-Oct-2016.)  (Proof modification is discouraged.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
