  "remarks" : " Value of a structure component extractor ` E ` .  Normally, ` E ` is a defined constant symbol such as ` Base ` ( ~ df-base ) and ` N ` is a fixed integer such as ` 1 ` . ` S ` is a structure, i.e. a specific member of a class of structures such as ` Poset ` ( ~ df-poset ) where ` S e. Poset ` . Note:  Normally, this theorem shouldn't be used outside of this section, because it requires hard-coded index values.  Instead, use ~ strfv . (Contributed by NM, 9-Sep-2011.)
