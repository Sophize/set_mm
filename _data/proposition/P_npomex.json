  "remarks" : " A simplifying observation, and an indication of why any attempt to develop a theory of the real numbers without the Axiom of Infinity is doomed to failure: since every member of ` P. ` is an infinite set, the negation of Infinity implies that ` P. ` , and hence ` RR ` , is empty. (Note that this proof, which used the fact that Dedekind cuts have no maximum, could just as well have used that they have no minimum, since they are downward-closed by ~ prcdnq and ~ nsmallnq ).
