  "remarks" : " Axiom of Distinct Variables.  The only axiom of predicate calculus requiring that variables be distinct (if we consider ~ ax-17 to be a metatheorem and not an axiom).  Axiom scheme C16' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  It apparently does not otherwise appear in the literature but is easily proved from textbook predicate calculus by cases.  It is a somewhat bizarre axiom since the antecedent is always false in set theory, but nonetheless it is technically necessary as you can see from its uses. This axiom is redundant if we include ~ ax-17 ; see theorem ~ ax16 . This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used.  It is proved above as theorem ~ ax16 .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
