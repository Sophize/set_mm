  "remarks" : " A totally bounded metric space is bounded.  This theorem fails for extended metrics - a bounded extended metric is a metric, but there are totally bounded extended metrics that are not metrics (if we were to weaken ~ istotbnd to only require that ` M ` be an extended metric).  A counterexample is the discrete extended metric (assigning distinct points distance ` +oo ` ) on a finite set.  (Contributed by Jeff Madsen, 2-Sep-2009.)  (Proof shortened by Mario Carneiro, 12-Sep-2015.) ",
