  "remarks" : " Axiom ~ ax-11o (\"o\" for \"old\") was the original version of ~ ax-11 , before it was discovered (in Jan. 2007) that the shorter ~ ax-11 could replace it.  It appears as Axiom scheme C15' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105, from which it can be proved by cases.  To understand this theorem more easily, think of \" ` -. A. x x = y -> ` ...\" as informally meaning \"if ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables then...\"  The antecedent becomes false if the same variable is substituted for ` x ` and ` y ` , ensuring the theorem is sound whenever this is the case.  In some later theorems, we call an antecedent of the form ` -. A. x x = y ` a \"distinctor.\" This axiom is redundant, as shown by theorem ~ ax11o . This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used.  It is proved above as theorem ~ ax11o .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
