  "remarks" : " At least one individual exists.  This is not a theorem of free logic, which is sound in empty domains.  For such a logic, we would add this theorem as an axiom of set theory (Axiom 0 of [Kunen] p. 10).  In the system consisting of ~ ax-5 through ~ ax-14 and ~ ax-17 , all axioms other than ~ ax-9 are believed to be theorems of free logic, although the system without ~ ax-9 is probably not complete in free logic.
