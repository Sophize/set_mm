  "remarks" : " Axiom ~ ax-c11 was the original version of ~ ax-c11n (\"n\" for \"new\"), before it was discovered (in May 2008) that the shorter ~ ax-c11n could replace it.  It appears as Axiom scheme C11' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used.  It is proved above as theorem ~ axc11 .  (Contributed by NM, 10-May-1993.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
