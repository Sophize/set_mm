  "remarks" : " Equality of a class variable and a class abstraction (also called a class builder).  Theorem 5.1 of [Quine] p. 34.  This theorem shows the relationship between expressions with class abstractions and expressions with class variables.  Note that ~ abbi and its relatives are among those useful for converting theorems with class variables to equivalent theorems with wff variables, by first substituting a class abstraction for each class variable. Class variables can always be eliminated from a theorem to result in an equivalent theorem with wff variables, and vice-versa.  The idea is roughly as follows.  To convert a theorem with a wff variable ` ph ` (that has a free variable ` x ` ) to a theorem with a class variable ` A ` , we substitute ` x e. A ` for ` ph ` throughout and simplify, where ` A ` is a new class variable not already in the wff.  An example is the conversion of ~ zfauscl to ~ inex1 (look at the instance of ~ zfauscl that occurs in the proof of ~ inex1 ).  Conversely, to convert a theorem with a class variable ` A ` to one with ` ph ` , we substitute ` { x | ph } ` for ` A ` throughout and simplify, where ` x ` and ` ph ` are new setvar and wff variables not already in the wff.  Examples include ~ dfsymdif2 and ~ cp ; the latter derives a formula containing wff variables from substitution instances of the class variables in its equivalent formulation ~ cplem2 .  For more information on class variables, see Quine pp. 15-21 and/or Takeuti and Zaring pp. 10-13.
