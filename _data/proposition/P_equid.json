(Proof shortened by Wolf Lammen, 5-Feb-2018.) \n\n---\n\n Identity law for equality (reflexivity).  Lemma 6 of [Tarski] p. 68. This is often an axiom of equality in textbook systems, but we don't need it as an axiom since it can be proved from our other axioms. This proof is similar to Tarski's and makes use of a dummy variable ` y ` .  It also works in intuitionistic logic, unlike some other possible ways of proving this theorem.
