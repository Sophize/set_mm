  "remarks" : " The product of two numbers' least common multiple and greatest common divisor is the absolute value of the product of the two numbers.  In particular, that absolute value _is_ the least common multiple of two coprime numbers, for which ` ( M gcd N ) = 1 ` . Multiple methods exist for proving this, and it is often proven either as a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic ~ 1arith or of B&eacute;zout's identity ~ bezout ; see e.g. ~ https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Product_of_GCD_and_LCM and ~ https://math.stackexchange.com/a/470827 .  This proof uses the latter to first confirm it for positive integer ` M ` and ` N ` (the \"Second Proof\" in the above Stack Exchange page), then shows that implies it for all nonzero integer inputs, then finally uses ~ lcm0val to show it applies when either or both inputs are zero.
