  "remarks" : " The first infinite cardinal number, discovered by Georg Cantor in 1873, has the same size as the set of natural numbers ` _om ` (and under our particular definition is also equal to it).  In the literature, the argument of the aleph function is often written as a subscript, and the first aleph is written ` aleph ` _0.  Exercise 3 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 91.  Also Definition 12(i) of [Suppes] p. 228.  From Mosh&eacute Machover, _Set Theory, Logic, and Their Limitations_, p. 95:  \"Aleph...the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet...is also the first letter of the Hebrew word...(_einsoph_, meaning infinity), which is a cabbalistic appellation of the deity.  The notation is due to Cantor, who was deeply interested in mysticism.\"  (Contributed by NM, 21-Oct-2003.)  (Revised by Mario Carneiro, 13-Sep-2013.) ",
