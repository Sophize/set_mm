  "remarks" : " A _magma_ is a set equipped with a closed operation.  Definition 1 of [BourbakiAlg1] p. 1, or definition of a groupoid in section I.1 of [Bruck] p. 1.  Note:  The term \"groupoid\" is now widely used to refer to other objects:  (small) categories all of whose morphisms are invertible, or groups with a partial function replacing the binary operation.  Therefore, we will only use the term \"magma\" for the present notion in set.mm.  (Contributed by AV, 6-Jan-2020.) ",
