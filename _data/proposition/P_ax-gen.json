This rule says that if something is unconditionally true, then it is true for all values of a variable.  For example, if we have proved ` x = x ` , we can conclude ` A. x x = x ` or even ` A. y x = x ` .  Theorem ~ allt shows the special case ` A. x T. ` .  Theorem ~ spi shows we can go the other way also: in other words we can add or remove universal quantifiers from the beginning of any theorem as required.
