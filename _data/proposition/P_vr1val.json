  "remarks" : " The value of the generator of the power series algebra (the ` X ` in ` R [ [ X ] ] ` ).  Since all univariate polynomial rings over a fixed base ring ` R ` are isomorphic, we don't bother to pass this in as a parameter; internally we are actually using the empty set as this generator and ` 1o = { (/) } ` is the index set (but for most purposes this choice should not be visible anyway).
