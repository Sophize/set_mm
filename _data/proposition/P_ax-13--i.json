  "remarks" : " Axiom of Equality.  One of the equality and substitution axioms for a non-logical predicate in our predicate calculus with equality.  It substitutes equal variables into the left-hand side of the ` e. ` binary predicate.  Axiom scheme C12' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). It is a special case of Axiom B8 (p. 75) of system S2 of [Tarski] p. 77. \"Non-logical\" means that the predicate is not a primitive of predicate calculus proper but instead is an extension to it.  \"Binary\" means that the predicate has two arguments.  In a system of predicate calculus with equality, like ours, equality is not usually considered to be a non-logical predicate.  In systems of predicate calculus without equality, it typically would be.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) ",
