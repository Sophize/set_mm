  "remarks" : " The class-form not-free predicate defines a symmetric binary relation on var metavariables (irreflexivity is proved by ~ nfnid with additional axioms; see also ~ nfcv ).  This could be proved from ~ aecom and ~ nfcvb but the latter requires a domain with at least two objects (hence uses extra axioms).  (Contributed by BJ, 30-Sep-2018.)  Proof modification is discouraged to avoid use of ~ eqcomd instead of ~ bj-equcomd ; removing dependency on ~ ax-ext is possible: prove weak versions (i.e. replace classes with setvars) of ~ drnfc1 , ~ eleq2d (using ~ elequ2 ), ~ nfcvf , ~ dvelimc , ~ dvelimdc , ~ nfcvf2 . (Proof modification is discouraged.) ",
