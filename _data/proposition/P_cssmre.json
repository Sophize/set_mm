  "remarks" : " The closed subspaces of a pre-Hilbert space are a Moore system.  Unlike many of our other examples of closure systems, this one is _not_ usually an algebraic closure system ~ df-acs : consider the Hilbert space of sequences ` NN --> RR ` with convergent sum; the subspace of all sequences with finite support is the classic example of a non-closed subspace, but for every finite set of sequences of finite support, there is a finite-dimensional (and hence closed) subspace containing all of the sequences, so if closed subspaces were an algebraic closure system this would violate ~ acsfiel .
