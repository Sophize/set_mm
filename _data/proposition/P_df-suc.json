  "remarks" : " Define the successor of a class.  When applied to an ordinal number, the successor means the same thing as \"plus 1\" (see ~ oa1suc ).  Definition 7.22 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 41, who use \"+ 1\" to denote this function.  Our definition is a generalization to classes.  Although it is not conventional to use it with proper classes, it has no effect on a proper class ( ~ sucprc ), so that the successor of any ordinal class is still an ordinal class ( ~ ordsuc ), simplifying certain proofs.  Some authors denote the successor operation with a prime (apostrophe-like) symbol, such as Definition 6 of [Suppes] p. 134 and the definition of successor in [Mendelson] p. 246 (who uses the symbol \"Suc\" as a predicate to mean \"is a successor ordinal\").  The definition of successor of [Enderton] p. 68 denotes the operation with a plus-sign superscript.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Aug-1993.) \n\n---\n\n Define the successor of a class.
