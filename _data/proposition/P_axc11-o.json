  "remarks" : " Show that ~ ax-c11 can be derived from ~ ax-c11n .  An open problem is whether this theorem can be derived from ~ ax-c11n and the others when ~ ax-12 is replaced with ~ ax-c15 .  See theorem ~ axc11nfromc11 for the rederivation of ~ ax-c11n from ~ axc11 . Normally, ~ axc11 should be used rather than ~ ax-c11 or ~ axc11-o , except by theorems specifically studying the latter's properties. (Contributed by NM, 16-May-2008.)
