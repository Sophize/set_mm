  "remarks" : " Axiom of Equality.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  This is similar to, but not quite, a transitive law for equality (proved later as ~ equtr ).  Axiom scheme C8' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  Also appears as Axiom C7 of [Monk2] p. 105. Axioms ~ ax-8 through ~ ax-16 are the axioms having to do with equality, substitution, and logical properties of our binary predicate ` e. ` (which later in set theory will mean \"is a member of\").  Note that all axioms except ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 are still valid even when ` x ` , ` y ` , and ` z ` are replaced with the same variable because they do not have any distinct variable (Metamath's $d) restrictions.  Distinct variable restrictions are required for ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 only.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) ",
