  "remarks" : " The classic \"Hello world\" benchmark has been translated into 314 computer programming languages - see ~ http://www.roesler-ac.de/wolfram/hello.htm .  However, for many years it eluded a proof that it is more than just a conjecture, even though a wily mathematician once claimed, \"I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.\"  Using an IBM 709 mainframe, a team of mathematicians led by Prof.  Loof Lirpa, at the New College of Tahiti, were finally able put it rest with a remarkably short proof only 4 lines long.  (Contributed by Prof.  Loof Lirpa, 1-Apr-2007.) (Proof modification is discouraged.)  (New usage is discouraged.) ",
