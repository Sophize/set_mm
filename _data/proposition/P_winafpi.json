  "remarks" : " This theorem, which states that a nontrivial inaccessible cardinal is its own aleph number, is stated here in inference form, where the assumptions are in the hypotheses rather than an antecedent.  Often, we use ~ dedth to turn this type of statement into the closed form statement ~ winafp , but in this case, since it is consistent with ZFC that there are no nontrivial inaccessible cardinals, it is not possible to prove ~ winafp using this theorem and ~ dedth , in ZFC. (You can prove this if you use ~ ax-groth , though.)  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 28-May-2014.) ",
