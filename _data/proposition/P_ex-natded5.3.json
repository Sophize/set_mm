  "remarks" : " Theorem 5.3 of [Clemente] p. 16, translated line by line using an interpretation of natural deduction in Metamath. A much more efficient proof, using more of Metamath and MPE's capabilities, is shown in ~ ex-natded5.3-2 . A proof without context is shown in ~ ex-natded5.3i . For information about ND and Metamath, see the <HTML> <A HREF=\"mmnatded.html\">page on Deduction Form and Natural Deduction in Metamath Proof Explorer</A></HTML>. The original proof, which uses Fitch style, was written as follows: <HTML> <TABLE BORDER> <TR><TH NOWRAP>#</TH><TH>MPE#</TH><TH>ND Expression</TH> <TH NOWRAP>MPE Translation</TH><TH>ND Rationale</TH> <TH>MPE Rationale</TH></TR> <TR><TD>1</TD><TD>2;3</TD><TD NOWRAP> ` ( ps -> ch ) ` </TD> <TD NOWRAP> ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` </TD> <TD>Given</TD> <TD>$e; ~ adantr to move it into the ND hypothesis</TD></TR> <TR><TD>2</TD><TD>5;6</TD><TD NOWRAP> ` ( ch -> th ) ` </TD> <TD NOWRAP> ` ( ph -> ( ch -> th ) ) ` </TD> <TD>Given</TD> <TD>$e; ~ adantr to move it into the ND hypothesis</TD></TR> <TR><TD>3</TD><TD>1</TD><TD> ...| ` ps ` </TD> <TD> ` ( ( ph /\\ ps ) -> ps ) ` </TD> <TD>ND hypothesis assumption</TD> <TD> ~ simpr , to access the new assumption </TD></TR> <TR><TD>4</TD><TD>4</TD><TD> ... ` ch ` </TD> <TD> ` ( ( ph /\\ ps ) -> ch ) ` </TD> <TD> ` -> `E 1,3</TD> <TD> ~ mpd , the MPE equivalent of ` -> `E, 1.3. ~ adantr was used to transform its dependency (we could also use ~ imp to get this directly from 1) </TD></TR> <TR><TD>5</TD><TD>7</TD><TD> ... ` th ` </TD> <TD> ` ( ( ph /\\ ps ) -> th ) ` </TD> <TD> ` -> `E 2,4</TD> <TD> ~ mpd , the MPE equivalent of ` -> `E, 4,6. ~ adantr was used to transform its dependency</TD></TR> <TR><TD>6</TD><TD>8</TD><TD> ... ` ( ch /\\ th ) ` </TD> <TD> ` ( ( ph /\\ ps ) -> ( ch /\\ th ) ) ` </TD> <TD> ` /\\ `I 4,5</TD> <TD> ~ jca , the MPE equivalent of ` /\\ `I, 4,7</TD></TR> <TR><TD>7</TD><TD>9</TD><TD NOWRAP> ` ( ps -> ( ch /\\ th ) ) ` </TD> <TD NOWRAP> ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ( ch /\\ th ) ) ) ` </TD> <TD> ` -> `I 3,6</TD> <TD> ~ ex , the MPE equivalent of ` -> `I, 8</TD></TR> </TABLE> </HTML> The original used Latin letters for predicates; we have replaced them with Greek letters to follow Metamath naming conventions and so that it is easier to follow the Metamath translation. The Metamath line-for-line translation of this natural deduction approach precedes every line with an antecedent including ` ph ` and uses the Metamath equivalents of the natural deduction rules.
