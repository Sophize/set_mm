  "remarks" : " In classical logic all wffs are testable, that is, it is always true that ` ( -. ph \\/ -. -. ph ) ` .  This is not necessarily true in intuitionistic logic.  In intuitionistic logic, if this statement is true for some ` ph ` , then ` ph ` is _testable_.  The proof is trivial because it's simply a special case of the law of the excluded middle, which is true in classical logic but not necessarily true in intuitionisic logic. (Contributed by David A.
