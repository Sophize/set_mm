  "remarks" : " The degree of the zero polynomial is zero.  Note: this differs from some other definitions of the degree of the zero polynomial, such as ` -u 1 , -oo ` or undefined.  But it is convenient for us to define it this way, so that we have ~ dgrcl , ~ dgreq0 and ~ coeid without having to special-case zero, although ~ plydivalg is a little more complicated as a result.
