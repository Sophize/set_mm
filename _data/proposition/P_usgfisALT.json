  "remarks" : " An undirected simple graph of finite order (i.e. with a finite number of vertices) is of finite size, i.e. it has also only a finite number of edges, analogous to ~ usgrafis .  Remark:  The proof of this theorem is very long compared with ~ usgrafis , because the theorem ~ brfi1ind to perform the finite induction is taylored for binary relations, so that the theorem itself and the used lemmas must be transformed accordingly. Maybe a variant of ~ brfi1ind could be provided, which is better suitable for this theorem.  (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens, 6-Jan-2018.)  (Revised by AV, 15-Jan-2018.) (New usage is discouraged.)  (Proof modification is discouraged.) ",
