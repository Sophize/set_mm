  "remarks" : " Equivalent of Axiom of Choice.  We do not insist that ` f ` be a function.  However, theorem ~ ac5 , derived from this one, shows that this form of the axiom does imply that at least one such set ` f ` whose existence we assert is in fact a function.  Axiom of Choice of [TakeutiZaring] p. 83. Takeuti and Zaring call this \"weak choice\" in contrast to \"strong choice\" ` E. F A. z ( z =/= (/) -> ( F `` z ) e. z ) ` , which asserts the existence of a universal choice function but requires second-order quantification on (proper) class variable ` F ` and thus cannot be expressed in our first-order formalization.  However, it has been shown that ZF plus strong choice is a conservative extension of ZF plus weak choice.  See Ulrich Felgner, \"Comparison of the axioms of local and universal choice,\" _Fundamenta Mathematica_, 71, 43-62 (1971). Weak choice can be strengthened in a different direction to choose from a collection of proper classes; see ~ ac6s5 .  (Contributed by NM, 21-Jul-1996.) ",
