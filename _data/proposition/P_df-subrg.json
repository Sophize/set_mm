  "remarks" : " Define a subring of a ring as a set of elements that is a ring in its own right and contains the multiplicative identity. The additional constraint is necessary because the multiplicative identity of a ring, unlike the additive identity of a ring/group or the multiplicative identity of a field, cannot be identified by a local property.  Thus, it is possible for a subset of a ring to be a ring while not containing the true identity if it contains a false identity. For instance, the subset ` ( ZZ X. { 0 } ) ` of ` ( ZZ X. ZZ ) ` (where multiplication is component-wise) contains the false identity ` <. 1 , 0 >. ` which preserves every element of the subset and thus appears to be the identity of the subset, but is not the identity of the larger ring.
