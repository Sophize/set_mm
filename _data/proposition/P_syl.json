  "remarks" : " An inference version of the transitive laws for implication ~ imim2 and ~ imim1 (and ~ imim1i and ~ imim2i ), which Russell and Whitehead call \"the principle of the syllogism...because...the syllogism in Barbara is derived from them\" (quote after Theorem *2.06 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 101).  Some authors call this law a \"hypothetical syllogism.\" (A bit of trivia: this is the most commonly referenced assertion in our database.  In second place is ~ eqid , followed by ~ syl2anc , ~ adantr , ~ syl3anc , and ~ ax-mp .  The Metamath program command 'show usage' shows the number of references.)
