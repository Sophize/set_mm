  "remarks" : " Candidate definition for ~ df-clel (the need for it is exposed in ~ bj-ax8 ).  The similarity of the hypothesis and the conclusion makes it clear that this definition merely extends to class variables something that is true for setvar variables, hence is conservative. This definition should be directly referenced only by ~ bj-dfclel , which should be used instead.  The proof is irrelevant since this is a proposal for an axiom. Note: the current definition ~ df-clel already mentions ~ cleljust as a justification; here, we merely propose to put it as a hypothesis to make things clearer.  (Contributed by BJ, 27-Jun-2019.) (Proof modification is discouraged.)  (New usage is discouraged.) ",
