  "remarks" : " Define the function mapping a graph to its size.  This definition is very general:  It defines the size for any ordered pair as the size of the domain of its second component (which even needs not to be a function). In the definition of [Bollobas] p. 3, the size of a graph G is denoted by e(G) (and implicitly defined by e(G) = |E(G)|, which corresponds to our definition, see ~ uhgraopsiz : ` ( GrSize `` <. V , E >. ) = ( # `` dom E ) ` , or ~ usgsizedg : ` ( GrSize `` G ) = ( # `` ( Edges `` G ) ) ) ` .  (Contributed by AV, 3-Jan-2020.) ",
