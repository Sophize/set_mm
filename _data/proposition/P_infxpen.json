  "remarks" : " Every infinite ordinal is equinumerous to its Cartesian product. Proposition 10.39 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 94, whose proof we follow closely.  The key idea is to show that the relation ` R ` is a well-ordering of ` ( On X. On ) ` with the additional property that ` R ` -initial segments of ` ( x X. x ) ` (where ` x ` is a limit ordinal) are of cardinality at most ` x ` .  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 9-Mar-2013.)
