It was derived as theorem ~ axpr above and is therefore redundant, but we state it as a separate axiom here so that its uses can be identified more easily.

Axiom 2 of [Crosilla] p. \"Axioms of CZF and IZF\", except (a) unnecessary quantifiers are removed, and (b) Crosilla has a biconditional rather than an implication (but the two are equivalent by ~ bm1.3ii ).
