  "remarks" : " The Axiom of Pairing of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.  Axiom 2 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 15.  In some textbooks this is stated as a separate axiom; here we show it is redundant since it can be derived from the other axioms. This theorem should not be referenced by any proof other than ~ axpr . Instead, use ~ zfpair2 below so that the uses of the Axiom of Pairing can be more easily identified.  (Contributed by NM, 18-Oct-1995.) (New usage is discouraged.) ",
