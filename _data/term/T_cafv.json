  "remarks" : " Extend the definition of a class to include the value of a function. (Read:  The value of ` F ` at ` A ` , or \" ` F ` of ` A ` .\").  In a previous version, the symbol \" ' \" was used.  However, since the similarity with the symbol ` `` ` used for the current definition of a function's value (see ~ df-fv ), which, by the way, was intended to visualize that in many cases ` `` ` and \" ' \" are exchangeable, makes reading the theorems, especially those which uses both definitions as ~ dfafv2 , very difficult, 3 apostrophes ` ''' ` are used now so that it's easier to distinguish from ~ df-fv and ~ df-ima .  And not three backticks ( three times ` `` ` ) since that would be annoying to escape in a comment.  (See remark of Norman Megill and Gerard Lang at ~ https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/metamath/cteNUppB6A4 ). \n\n---\n\nThis syntax is primitive. The first axiom using it is #P_df-afv|NAV_LINK|HIDE_TVI.\n\n---"
