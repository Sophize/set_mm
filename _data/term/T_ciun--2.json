  "remarks" : " Extend class notation to include indexed union.  Note:  Historically (prior to 21-Oct-2005), set.mm used the notation ` U. x e. A B ` , with the same union symbol as ~ cuni .  While that syntax was unambiguous, it did not allow for LALR parsing of the syntax constructions in set.mm.  The new syntax uses a distinguished symbol ` U_ ` instead of ` U. ` and does allow LALR parsing.  Thanks to Peter Backes for suggesting this change. \n\n--- Extend class notation to include indexed union.  Note:  Historically (prior to 21-Oct-2005), set.mm used the notation ` U. x e.
