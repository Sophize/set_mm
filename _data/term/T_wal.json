  "remarks" : " Extend wff definition to include the universal quantifier ('for all'). ` A. x ph ` is read \" ` ph ` (phi) is true for all ` x ` .\"  Typically, in its final application ` ph ` would be replaced with a wff containing a (free) occurrence of the variable ` x ` , for example ` x = y ` .  In a universe with a finite number of objects, \"for all\" is equivalent to a big conjunction (AND) with one wff for each possible case of ` x ` . When the universe is infinite (as with set theory), such a propositional-calculus equivalent is not possible because an infinitely long formula has no meaning, but conceptually the idea is the same. \n\n---\n\nThis syntax is primitive. The first axiom using it is #P_df-tru|NAV_LINK|HIDE_TVI.\n\n---"
