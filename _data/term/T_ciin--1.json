  "remarks" : " Extend class notation to include indexed intersection.  Note: Historically (prior to 21-Oct-2005), set.mm used the notation ` |^| x e. A B ` , with the same intersection symbol as ~ cint .  Although that syntax was unambiguous, it did not allow for LALR parsing of the syntax constructions in set.mm.  The new syntax uses a distinguished symbol ` |^|_ ` instead of ` |^| ` and does allow LALR parsing.  Thanks to Peter Backes for suggesting this change. \n\n---\n\nThis syntax is primitive. The first axiom using it is #P_df-iin.\n\n---"
