  "remarks" : " Extend wff definition to include atomic formulas using the equality predicate. (Instead of introducing ~ weq as an axiomatic statement, as was done in an older version of this database, we introduce it by \"proving\" a special case of set theory's more general ~ wceq .  This lets us avoid overloading the ` = ` connective, thus preventing ambiguity that would complicate certain Metamath parsers.  However, logically ~ weq is considered to be a primitive syntax, even though here it is artificially \"derived\" from ~ wceq .  Note:  To see the proof steps of this syntax proof, type \"show proof weq /all\" in the Metamath program.)  (Contributed by NM, 24-Jan-2006.) \n\n---\n\n---\n\nThis syntax is primitive. It may be defined by the following axioms: \n#P_df-sb|NAV_LINK|HIDE_TVI\n#P_ax-8|NAV_LINK|HIDE_TVI\n"
