Our class variables ` A ` , ` B ` , etc. range over class builders (implicitly in the case of defined class terms such as ~ df-nul ).  Note that a setvar variable can be expressed as a class builder per theorem ~ cvjust , justifying the assignment of setvar variables to class variables via the use of ~ cv . \n\n--- Introduce the class builder or class abstraction notation (\"the class of sets ` x ` such that ` ph ` is true\").
