  "remarks" : " Extend class notation with the base set of a normed complex vector space. (Note that ` BaseSet ` is capitalized because, once it is fixed for a particular vector space ` U ` , it is not a function, unlike e.g. ` normCV ` .  This is our typical convention.) (New usage is discouraged.) \n\n---\n\nThis syntax is primitive. The first axiom using it is #P_df-ba|NAV_LINK|HIDE_TVI.\n\n---"
