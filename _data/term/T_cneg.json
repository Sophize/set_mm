  "remarks" : " Extend class notation to include unary minus.  The symbol ` -u ` is not a class by itself but part of a compound class definition.  We do this rather than making it a formal function since it is so commonly used. Note:  We use different symbols for unary minus ( ` -u ` ) and subtraction ~ cmin ( ` - ` ) to prevent syntax ambiguity.  For example, looking at the syntax definition ~ co , if we used the same symbol then \" ` ( - A - B ) ` \" could mean either \" ` - A ` \" minus \" ` B ` \", or it could represent the (meaningless) operation of classes \" ` - ` \" and \" ` - B ` \" connected with \"operation\" \" ` A ` \". On the other hand, \" ` ( -u A - B ) ` \" is unambiguous. \n\n---\n\nThis syntax is primitive. The first axiom using it is #P_df-neg|NAV_LINK|HIDE_TVI.\n\n---"
