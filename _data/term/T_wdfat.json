  "remarks" : " Extend the definition of a wff to include the \"defined at\" predicate. (Read:  (The Function) ` F ` is defined at (the argument) ` A ` ).  In a previous version, the token \"def@\" was used.  However, since the @ is used (informally) as a replacement for $ in commented out sections that may be deleted some day.  While there is no violation of any standard to use the @ in a token, it could make the search for such commented-out sections slightly more difficult.  (See remark of Norman Megill at ~ https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/metamath/cteNUppB6A4 ). \n\n---\n\nThis syntax is primitive. The first axiom using it is #P_df-dfat|NAV_LINK|HIDE_TVI.\n\n---"
