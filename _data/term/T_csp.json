  "remarks" : " Extend class notation with inner (scalar) product in Hilbert space.  In the literature, the inner product of ` A ` and ` B ` is usually written ` <. A , B >. ` but our operation notation allows us to use existing theorems about operations and also eliminates ambiguity with the definition of an ordered pair ~ df-op . \n\n---\n\nThis syntax is primitive. The first axiom using it is #P_df-hnorm.\n\n---"
